The Holocene variability in the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) based on
speleothem δ(18)O records has inconsistencies in timing, duration, and expression
of millennial-scale events among nearby regions, and even within the same cave.
Here, we present another stalagmite δ(18)O record with multi-decadal time
resolution from the temperate Korean Peninsula (KP) for the last 5500 years in
order to compare with Holocene millennial-scale EASM events from Southeast Asia. 
Based on our new stalagmite δ(18)O record, millennial-scale events since the
mid-Holocene were successfully identified in the KP, representing a noticeable
cyclic pattern with a periodicity of around 1000 years. We propose that the
Holocene millennial-scale events are common hydroclimatic phenomena at least in
the East Asian monsoon system. Meanwhile, the shorter periodicity of
millennial-scale events than that of the North Atlantic region is likely to
decouple the EASM system from the North Atlantic climate system. This observation
suggests that weak EASM and North Atlantic Bond events may have been induced
independently by direct solar activity (and then possible feedback) and ocean-ice
sheet dynamics, respectively, rather than simple propagation from the North
Atlantic to the EASM regions.

Recent studies have reported that heat-related mortality decreased by adaptation 
during decades. However, since the frequency of extreme heat events is
increasing, it is difficult to conclude with certainty that the heat mortality
burden is decreasing. To examine temporal changes in mortality attributed to heat
extremes in Northeast Asia, we collected temperature and mortality data covering 
the years 1972-2012 from 57 cities of 3 countries (Taiwan, Korea, and Japan) in
Northeast Asia. Poisson regression curves were fitted to the data from each city.
The temporal changes in heat-mortality association were estimated with a
time-varying distributed lag non-linear model. Heat extremes were defined as
temperatures greater than the 97.5th percentiles of city-specific average
temperatures. Attributable deaths were calculated considering temporal variations
in exposure and relative risk. The estimates were then pooled through
meta-analysis. The results show that the mortality risk on extreme heat days
declined during the study period in all countries. However, as summer
temperatures in Japan have shown more heat extremes over time, the mortality risk
attributed to heat increased during 2003-2012 (0.32%) compared with 1972-1981
(0.19%). Thus, to assess the total health burden due to heat extremes related to 
climate change, public health strategies should focus on the temporal variation
in heat-mortality association as well as changes in the distribution of heat
extremes overtime.

Satellite data has been used to ascertain trends and correlations between climate
change and vegetation greenness in Asia. Our study utilized 33-year (1982-2014)
AVHRR-GIMMS (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer - Global Inventory
Modelling and Mapping Studies) NDVI3g and CRU TS (Climatic Research Unit Time
Series) climate variable (temperature, rainfall, and potential
evapotranspiration) time series. First, we estimated the overall trends for
vegetation greenness, climate variables and analyzed trends during summer (April 
to October), winter (November to March), and the entire year. Second, we carried 
out correlation and regression analyses to detect correlations between vegetation
greenness and climate variables. Our study revealed an increasing trend (0.05 to 
0.28) in temperature in northeastern India (bordering Bhutan), Southeast Bhutan, 
Yunnan Province of China, Northern Myanmar, Central Cambodia, northern Laos,
southern Vietnam, eastern Iran, southern Afghanistan, and southern Pakistan.
However, a decreasing trend in temperature (0.00 to -0.04) was noted for specific
areas in southern Asia including Central Myanmar and northwestern Thailand and
the Guangxi, Southern Gansu, and Shandong provinces of China. The results also
indicated an increasing trend for evapotranspiration and air temperature
accompanied by a decreasing trend for vegetation greenness and rainfall. The
temperature was found to be the main driver of the changing vegetation greenness 
in Kazakhstan, northern Mongolia, Northeast and Central China, North Korea, South
Korea, and northern Japan, showing an indirect relationship (R=0.84-0.96).

Concentration levels and seasonal variation of odorous gases at landfill site and
in surrounding areas within the city of Incheon, South Korea were investigated.
Sampling was conducted at 11 points (5 at landfill site and 6 in surrounding
areas). The highest concentrations of odorous gases (complex odor, ammonia,
acetaldehyde, and VOCs) at landfill site were found in summer, probably due to
fast decomposition of waste in high temperature related with more release of
ammonia. In addition, specific weather condition of dominant wind direction,
humidity and higher atmospheric pressure with no or lower wind speed caused
positive effect of higher aldehyde compounds and VOCs concentration. Similar to
other studies, sludge-related sampling site S-2, where a couple of odor
generating facilities including sludge mixing and drying treatment process are
located, showed the highest concentration levels of odorous gases compared to
other sites. Odor generation frequency was in the order of acetaldehyde
(68.8%) > ammonia (39.4%) > propionaldehyde (21.9%), which means the main
substances generating the unpleasant odor at landfill site was recognized as
aldehydes and ammonia due to combined effect of sludge-related facilities and
meteorological conditions. Offensive odor was not a big pollution issue in most
surrounding areas which are located within a circle of 5 km radius of the
landfill except high odor generation frequency of acetaldehyde and
propionaldehyde. Relative percentage differences (RPD) of odorous gases between
day and night times at landfill site were below 10%, which indicates that the
concentration differences in day and night were not severe. The relationship
between concentrations of complex odor and designated offensive odor substances
was analyzed statistically. At landfill site, the analysis shows that the
correlation coefficient between the concentration of complex odor and ammonia was
quite high (0.833), but it was much lower (0.129) in the surrounding areas due to
considerably lower concentrations of these substances.

Coccophora langsdorfii (Turner) Greville (Fucales) is an intertidal brown alga
that is endemic to Northeast Asia and increasingly endangered by habitat loss and
climate change. We sequenced the complete circular plastid and mitochondrial
genomes of C. langsdorfii. The circular plastid genome is 124,450 bp and contains
139 protein-coding, 28 tRNA and 6 rRNA genes. The circular mitochondrial genome
is 35,660 bp and contains 38 protein-coding, 25 tRNA and 3 rRNA genes. The
structure and gene content of the C. langsdorfii plastid genome is similar to
those of other species in the Fucales. The plastid genomes of brown algae in
other orders share similar gene content but exhibit large structural
recombination. The large in-frame insert in the cox2 gene in the mitochondrial
genome of C. langsdorfii is typical of other brown algae. We explored the effect 
of this insertion on the structure and function of the cox2 protein. We estimated
the usefulness of 135 plastid genes and 35 mitochondrial genes for developing
molecular markers. This study shows that 29 organellar genes will prove efficient
for resolving brown algal phylogeny. In addition, we propose a new molecular
marker suitable for the study of intraspecific genetic diversity that should be
tested in a large survey of populations of C. langsdorfii.

Although diurnal temperature range (DTR) is a key index of climate change, few
studies have reported the health burden of DTR and its temporal changes at a
multi-country scale. Therefore, we assessed the attributable risk fraction of DTR
on mortality and its temporal variations in a multi-country data set. We
collected time-series data covering mortality and weather variables from 308
cities in 10 countries from 1972 to 2013. The temporal change in DTR-related
mortality was estimated for each city with a time-varying distributed lag model. 
Estimates for each city were pooled using a multivariate meta-analysis. The
results showed that the attributable fraction of total mortality to DTR was 2.5% 
(95% eCI: 2.3-2.7%) over the entire study period. In all countries, the
attributable fraction increased from 2.4% (2.1-2.7%) to 2.7% (2.4-2.9%) between
the first and last study years. This study found that DTR has significantly
contributed to mortality in all the countries studied, and this attributable
fraction has significantly increased over time in the USA, the UK, Spain, and
South Korea. Therefore, because the health burden of DTR is not likely to reduce 
in the near future, countermeasures are needed to alleviate its impact on human
health.

Some studies have suggested that high ambient temperatures are a risk factor for 
kidney-related diseases. However, none have examined the association between
ambient temperature and acute kidney injury (AKI). This study aimed to examine
the association between daily mean temperature and AKI and identify high-risk
subgroups in this association. We obtained health insurance claim data from the
Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) for 24,800 admitted cases
of AKI during the period 2007-2014 in Seoul, Korea. Using a time-series design
and piecewise linear regression models, we estimated the percentage change in AKI
admissions associated with daily mean temperature after controlling for relevant 
covariates. Daily mean temperature and AKI admissions displayed an inverse
association in the cold season and a nonlinear relationship with a flexion point 
around 28.8°C in the warm season. AKI admissions increased by 23.3% (95%
confidence interval [CI]: 14.3, 33.0) per 1°C increase in mean temperature above 
the 28.8°C flexion point in the warm season. The estimates were greatest among
men with hypertension (55.1%; 95% CI: 25.1, 92.2). However, we did not observe
significant increases in AKI admissions associated with ambient temperature in
the cold season (0.4% [95% CI: -0.1, 0.9] per 1°C decrease in mean temperature). 
Our results suggest that hospital admissions for AKI increase in association with
high temperature, particularly among men with hypertension in the warm season.
Thus, early detection of AKI during heat wave periods is crucial. Our findings
also provide evidence for the local government to target populations vulnerable
to high ambient temperatures.

We examine several characteristics of the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WP) in the
past thirty years of mixed interannual variability and climate change. Our study 
presents the three-dimensional WP centroid (WPC) movement, WP heat content
anomaly (HC) and WP volume (WPV) on interannual to decadal time scales. We show
the statistically significant correlation between each parameter's interannual
anomaly and the NINO 3, NINO 3.4, NINO 4, SOI, and PDO indices. The longitudinal 
component of the WPC is most strongly correlated with NINO 4 (R = 0.78). The
depth component of the WPC has the highest correlation (R = -0.6) with NINO3.4.
The WPV and NINO4 have an R-Value of -0.65. HC has the highest correlation with
NINO3.4 (R = -0.52). During the study period of 1982-2014, the non-linear trends,
derived from ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), show that the WPV, WP 
depth and HC have all increased. The WPV has increased by 14% since 1982 and the 
HC has increased from -1 × 10(8) J/m(2) in 1993 to 10 × 10(8) J/m(2) in 2014.
While the largest variances in the latitudinal and longitudinal WPC locations are
associated with annual and seasonal timescales, the largest variances in the WPV 
and HC are due to the multi-decadal non-linear trend.

This study estimates the optimum sampling cycle using a statistical method for
biomass fraction. More than ten samples were collected from each of the three
municipal solid waste (MSW) facilities between June 2013 and March 2015 and the
biomass fraction was analyzed. The analysis data were grouped into monthly,
quarterly, semi-annual, and annual intervals and the optimum sampling cycle for
the detection of the biomass fraction was estimated. Biomass fraction data did
not show a normal distribution. Therefore, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test
was applied to compare the average values for each sample group. The
Kruskal-Wallis test results showed that the average monthly, quarterly,
semi-annual, and annual values for all three MSW incineration facilities were
equal. Therefore, the biomass fraction at the MSW incineration facilities should 
be calculated on a yearly cycle which is the longest period of the temporal
cycles tested.

BACKGROUND: The objective of the present study was to estimate the current and
projected burden of disease from high ambient temperature using population-based 
data sources of nationwide mortality and morbidity in Korea.
METHODS: Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) were estimated using
noninjury-related deaths, and cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases from
recently released nationwide health and mortality databases. Years of life lost
and years lost due to disability were measured based on the point prevalence and 
number of deaths during the study period. Future DALY attributable to heat waves 
were estimated from projected populations, and temperature predictions for the
years 2030 and 2050 were under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5
and 8.5 with summertime temperatures above threshold.
RESULTS: Relative risks (RR) of total mortality and of cardiovascular disease
were 1.02 (95% CI, 1.01, 1.02) and 1.08 (95% CI, 1.06, 1.09) for each 1°C
increase in temperature above threshold, respectively. The morbidity of
heat-related disease was RR 1.67 (95% CI, 1.64, 1.68) for each 1°C increase in
temperature above threshold. DALY for all-cause death were 0.49 DALY/1000 in
2011, 0.71 (0.71) DALY/1000 in 2030 and 0.77 (1.72) DALY/1000 in 2050 based on
RCP 4.5 (RCP 8.5). DALY for cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases were 1.24
DALY/1000 in 2011, 1.63 (1.82) DALY/1000 in 2030, and 1.76 (3.66) DALY/1000 in
2050 based on RCP 4.5 (RCP 8.5).
CONCLUSIONS: Future excess mortality due to high ambient temperature is expected 
to be profound in Korea. Efforts to mitigate climate change can provide
substantial health benefits via reducing heat-related mortality.

An important unknown in understanding the impact of climate change is the scope
of adaptation, which requires observations on historical time scales. We consider
how weather across U.S. history (1860-2000) has affected various measures of
productivity. Using cross-sectional and panel methods, we document significant
responses of agricultural and individual productivity to weather. We find strong 
effects of hotter and wetter weather early in U.S. history, but these effects
have been attenuated in recent decades. The results suggest that estimates from a
given period may be of limited use in forecasting the longer-term impacts of
climate change.

To develop the environmentally benign thermo-chemical process, this study placed 
great emphasis on the influence of CO2 on pyrolysis of cattle excreta for energy 
recovery. To this end, this study evaluates the possible enhanced energy recovery
from cattle excreta using CO2 as reaction medium/feedstock in the thermal
degradation of cattle excreta. The enhanced generation of CO in the presence of
CO2 reached up to 15.15mol% (reference value: 0.369mol%) at 690°C, which was
equivalent to ~4000 times more generation of CO. In addition to the enhanced
generation of CO, the enhanced generation of H2 and CH4 in the thermal
degradation of cattle excreta in CO2. Thus, the findings of this study revealed
two genuine roles of CO2: 1) enhanced thermal cracking of volatile organic
carbons (VOCs) evolved from the thermal degradation of cattle excreta and 2)
direct reaction between VOCs and CO2 via gas phase reaction.

Urban environments present novel and challenging habitats to wildlife. In
addition to well-known difference in abiotic factors between rural and urban
environments, the biotic environment, including microbial fauna, may also differ 
significantly. In this study, we aimed to compare the change in microbial
abundance on eggshells during incubation between urban and rural populations of a
passerine bird, the Eurasian Magpie (Pica pica), and examine the consequences of 
any differences in microbial abundances in terms of hatching success and nestling
survival. Using real-time PCR, we quantified the abundances of total bacteria,
Escherichia coli/Shigella spp., surfactin-producing Bacillus spp. and Candida
albicans on the eggshells of magpies. We found that urban magpie eggs harboured
greater abundances of E. coli/Shigella spp. and C. albicans before incubation
than rural magpie eggs. During incubation, there was an increase in the total
bacterial load, but a decrease in C. albicans on urban eggs relative to rural
eggs. Rural eggs showed a greater increase in E. coli/Shigella spp. relative to
their urban counterpart. Hatching success of the brood was generally lower in
urban than rural population. Nestling survival was differentially related with
the eggshell microbial abundance between urban and rural populations, which was
speculated to be the result of the difference in the strength of the interaction 
among the microbes. This is the first demonstration that avian clutches in urban 
and rural populations differ in eggshell microbial abundance, which can be
further related to the difference in hatching success and nestling survival in
these two types of environments. We suggest that future studies on the eggshell
microbes should investigate the interaction among the microbes, because the
incubation and/or environmental factors such as urbanization or climate condition
can influence the dynamic interactions among the microbes on the eggshells which 
can further determine the breeding success of the parents.

Wildlife-associated diseases and pathogens have increased in importance; however,
management of a large number of diseases and diversity of hosts is prohibitively 
expensive. Thus, the determination of priority wildlife pathogens and risk
factors for disease emergence is warranted. We used an online questionnaire
survey to assess release and exposure risks, and consequences of
wildlife-associated diseases and pathogens in the Republic of Korea (ROK). We
also surveyed opinions on pathways for disease exposure, and risk factors for
disease emergence and spread. For the assessment of risk, we employed a
two-tiered, statistical K-means clustering algorithm to group diseases into three
levels (high, medium and low) of perceived risk based on release and exposure
risks, societal consequences and the level of uncertainty of the experts'
opinions. To examine the experts' perceived risk of routes of introduction of
pathogens and disease amplification and spread, we used a Bayesian, multivariate 
normal order-statistics model. Six diseases or pathogens, including four
livestock and two wildlife diseases, were identified as having high risk with low
uncertainty. Similarly, 13 diseases were characterized as having high risk with
medium uncertainty with three of these attributed to livestock, six associated
with human disease, and the remainder having the potential to affect human,
livestock and wildlife (i.e., One Health). Lastly, four diseases were described
as high risk with high certainty, and were associated solely with fish diseases. 
Experts identified migration of wildlife, international human movement and
illegal importation of wildlife as the three routes posing the greatest risk of
pathogen introduction into ROK. Proximity of humans, livestock and wildlife was
the most significant risk factor for promoting the spread of wildlife-associated 
diseases and pathogens, followed by high density of livestock populations,
habitat loss and environmental degradation, and climate change. This study
provides useful information to decision makers responsible for allocating
resources to address disease risks. This approach provided a rapid,
cost-effective method of risk assessment of wildlife-associated diseases and
pathogens for which the published literature is sparse.

Angelica gigas Nakai is an important medicinal herb, widely utilized in Asian
countries especially in Korea, Japan, and China. Although it is a vital medicinal
herb, the lack of sequencing data and efficient molecular markers has limited the
application of a genetic approach for horticultural improvements. Simple sequence
repeats (SSRs) are universally accepted molecular markers for population
structure study. In this study, we found over 130,000 SSRs, ranging from di- to
deca-nucleotide motifs, using the genome sequence of Manchu variety (MV) of A.
gigas, derived from next generation sequencing (NGS). From the putative SSR
regions identified, a total of 16,496 primer sets were successfully designed.
Among them, we selected 848 SSR markers that showed polymorphism from in silico
analysis and contained tri- to hexa-nucleotide motifs. We tested 36 SSR primer
sets for polymorphism in 16 A. gigas accessions. The average polymorphism
information content (PIC) was 0.69; the average observed heterozygosity (HO)
values, and the expected heterozygosity (HE) values were 0.53 and 0.73,
respectively. These newly developed SSR markers would be useful tools for
molecular genetics, genotype identification, genetic mapping, molecular breeding,
and studying species relationships of the Angelica genus.

There has been much effort exerted to reduce one carbon (C1) gas emission to
address climate change. As one promising way to more conveniently utilize C1 gas,
several technologies have been developed to convert C1 gas into useful chemicals 
such as formic acid (FA). In this study, systems metabolic engineering was
utilized to engineer Mannheimia succiniciproducens to efficiently utilize FA.
(13) C isotope analysis of M. succiniciproducens showed that FA could be utilized
through formate dehydrogenase (FDH) reaction and/or the reverse reaction of
pyruvate formate lyase (PFL). However, the naturally favored forward reaction of 
PFL was found to lower the SA yield from FA. In addition, FA assimilation via FDH
was found to be more efficient than the reverse reaction of PFL. Thus, the M.
succiniciproducens LPK7 strain, which lacks in pfl, ldh, pta, and ack genes, was 
selected as a base strain. In silico metabolic analysis confirmed that
utilization of FA would be beneficial for the enhanced production of SA and
suggested FDH as an amplification target. To find a suitable FDH, four different 
FDHs from M. succiniciproducens, Methylobacterium extorquens, and Candida
boidinii were amplified in LPK7 strain to enhance FA assimilation. High-inoculum 
density cultivation using (13) C labeled sodium formate was performed to evaluate
FA assimilation efficiency. Fed-batch fermentations of the LPK7 (pMS3-fdh2 meq)
strain was carried out using glucose, sucrose, or glycerol as a primary carbon
source and FA as a secondary carbon source. As a result, this strain produced
76.11 g/L SA with the yield and productivity of 1.28 mol/mol and 4.08 g/L/h,
respectively, using sucrose and FA as dual carbon sources. The strategy employed 
here will be similarly applicable in developing microorganisms to utilize FA and 
to produce valuable chemicals and materials from FA.

Changes in microbial community induced by acid shock were studied in the context 
of potential release of acids to the environment due to chemical accidents. The
responses of microbial communities in three different soils to the exposure to
sulfuric or hydrofluoric acid and to the subsequent neutralization treatment were
investigated as functions of acid concentration and exposure time by using
16S-rRNA gene based pyrosequencing and DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel
Electrophoresis). Measurements of soil pH and dissolved ion concentrations
revealed that the added acids were neutralized to different degrees, depending on
the mineral composition and soil texture. Hydrofluoric acid was more effectively 
neutralized by the soils, compared with sulfuric acid at the same normality.
Gram-negative ß-Proteobacteria were shown to be the most acid-sensitive bacterial
strains, while spore-forming Gram-positive Bacilli were the most acid-tolerant.
The results of this study suggest that the Gram-positive to Gram-negative
bacterial ratio may serve as an effective bio-indicator in assessing the impact
of the acid shock on the microbial community. Neutralization treatments helped
recover the ratio closer to their original values. The findings of this study
show that microbial community changes as well as geochemical changes such as pH
and dissolved ion concentrations need to be considered in estimating the impact
of an acid spill, in selecting an optimal remediation strategy, and in deciding
when to end remedial actions at the acid spill impacted site.

Corn production, and its associated inputs, is a relatively large source of
greenhouse gas emissions and uses significant amounts of water and land, thus
contributing to climate change, fossil fuel depletion, local air pollutants, and 
local water scarcity. As large consumers of this corn, corporations in the
ethanol and animal protein industries are increasingly assessing and reporting
sustainability impacts across their supply chains to identify, prioritize, and
communicate sustainability risks and opportunities material to their operations. 
In doing so, many have discovered that the direct impacts of their owned
operations are dwarfed by those upstream in the supply chain, requiring
transparency and knowledge about environmental impacts along the supply chains.
Life cycle assessments (LCAs) have been used to identify hotspots of
environmental impacts at national levels, yet these provide little subnational
information necessary for guiding firms' specific supply networks. In this paper,
our Food System Supply-Chain Sustainability (FoodS(3)) model connects spatial,
firm-specific demand of corn purchasers with upstream corn production in the
United States through a cost minimization transport model. This provides a means 
to link county-level corn production in the United States to firm-specific demand
locations associated with downstream processing facilities. Our model
substantially improves current LCA assessment efforts that are confined to broad 
national or state level impacts. In drilling down to subnational levels of
environmental impacts that occur over heterogeneous areas and aggregating these
landscape impacts by specific supply networks, targeted opportunities for
improvements to the sustainability performance of supply chains are identified.

The present study combines data of microbial assemblages with high-resolution
paleoceanographic records from Core GC1 recovered in the Chukchi Sea. For the
first time, we have demonstrated that microbial habitat preferences are closely
linked to Holocene paleoclimate records, and found geological, geochemical, and
microbiological evidence for the inference of the sulphate-methane transition
zone (SMTZ) in the Chukchi Sea. In Core GC1, the layer of maximum crenarchaeol
concentration was localized surrounding the SMTZ. The vertically distributed
predominant populations of Gammaproteobacteria and Marine Group II Euryarchaeota 
(MG-II) were consistent with patterns of the known global SMTZs. MG-II was the
most prominent archaeal group, even within the layer of elevated concentrations
of crenarchaeol, an archaeal lipid biomarker most commonly used for Marine Group 
I Thaumarchaeota (MG-I). The distribution of MG-I and MG-II in Core GC1, as
opposed to the potential contribution of MG-I to the marine tetraether lipid
pool, suggests that the application of glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers
(GDGT)-based proxies needs to be carefully considered in the subsurface sediments
owing to the many unknowns of crenarchaeol. In conclusion, microbiological
profiles integrated with geological records seem to be useful for tracking
microbial habitat preference, which reflect climate-triggered changes from the
paleodepositional environment.

There has been an increase in tropical cyclones (TCs) in the western North
Pacific (WNP) that traverse with a northward recurving track towards East Asia
and a decrease in TC tracks entering the South China Sea (SCS) in the past few
decades. To investigate the potential impact of the prevailing TC track change on
Hong Kong air quality, an analysis has been carried out based on historical data 
(1991 to 2010) of TC tracks and air quality. Compared to TCs in other regions,
TCs in the vicinity of Taiwan (Region 2, R2) have the greatest impact on Hong
Kong air quality due to regional transport of air pollutants from the highly
industrialized Pearl River Delta (PRD). In the last twenty years, the number of
days with TCs in R2 (May to October) has increased by 45% from 111days in the
period 1991-2000 to 161days in 2001-2010, during which there was an increase in
yearly TC-related pollution episodes of approximately 3 episodes per year in Hong
Kong. The enhancement of mean O3 concentration due to TCs in R2 is reported as
82% (~50.8μg/m(3) at a rural station) and 58% (~16.8μg/m(3) at an urban station) 
higher than the summer averages. A similar enhancement is also observed for PM10 
(called RSP) and SO2 with an average of 70% (i.e., 22.2μg/m(3)) and 100% (i.e.,
15.2μg/m(3)) increases, respectively. Overall, the 20years of historical data
show that the O3 concentrations on the TC-affected days are increasing at the
estimated rates of 0.5μg/m(3) and 2.6μg/m(3) per year, respectively, in the urban
and remote areas, which are significantly higher than the increase of 0.3μg/m(3) 
and 0.4μg/m(3) per year in the average summer concentrations.

Antarctic marine organisms are adapted to an extreme environment, characterized
by a very low but stable temperature and a strong seasonality in food
availability arousing from variations in day length. Ocean organisms are
particularly vulnerable to global climate change with some regions being impacted
by temperature increase and changes in primary production. Climate change also
affects the biotic components of marine ecosystems and has an impact on the
distribution and seasonal physiology of Antarctic marine organisms. Knowledge on 
the impact of climate change in key species is highly important because their
performance affects ecosystem functioning. To predict the effects of climate
change on marine ecosystems, a holistic understanding of the life history and
physiology of Antarctic key species is urgently needed. DEB (Dynamic Energy
Budget) theory captures the metabolic processes of an organism through its entire
life cycle as a function of temperature and food availability. The DEB model is a
tool that can be used to model lifetime feeding, growth, reproduction, and their 
responses to changes in biotic and abiotic conditions. In this study, we estimate
the DEB model parameters for the bivalve Laternula elliptica using
literature-extracted and field data. The DEB model we present here aims at better
understanding the biology of L. elliptica and its levels of adaptation to its
habitat with a special focus on food seasonality. The model parameters describe a
metabolism specifically adapted to low temperatures, with a low maintenance cost 
and a high capacity to uptake and mobilise energy, providing this organism with a
level of energetic performance matching that of related species from temperate
regions. It was also found that L. elliptica has a large energy reserve that
allows enduring long periods of starvation. Additionally, we applied DEB
parameters to time-series data on biological traits (organism condition, gonad
growth) to describe the effect of a varying environment in food and temperature
on the organism condition and energy use. The DEB model developed here for L.
elliptica allowed us to improve benchmark knowledge on the ecophysiology of this 
key species, providing new insights in the role of food availability and
temperature on its life cycle and reproduction strategy.

Haemaphysalis longicornis is the only species of tick present in New Zealand
which infests livestock and is also the only competent vector for Theileria
orientalis. Since 2012, New Zealand has suffered from an epidemic of infectious
bovine anaemia associated with T. orientalis, an obligate intracellular protozoan
parasite of cattle and buffaloes. The aim of this study was to predict the
spatial distribution of habitat suitability of New Zealand for the tick H.
longicornis using a simple rule-based climate envelope model, to validate the
model against published data and use the validated model to project an expansion 
in habitat suitability for H. longicornis under two alternative climate change
scenarios for the periods 2046-2065 and 2081-2100, relative to the climate of
1981-2010. A rule-based climate envelope model was developed based on the
environmental requirements for off-host tick survival. The resulting model was
validated against a maximum entropy environmental niche model of environmental
suitability for T. orientalis transmission and against a H. longicornis
occurrence map. Validation was completed using the I-similarity statistic and by 
linear regression. The H. longicornis climate envelope model predicted that 75%
of cattle farms in the North Island, 3% of cattle farms in the South Island and
54% of cattle farms in New Zealand overall have habitats potentially suitable for
the establishment of H. longicornis. The validation methods showed an acceptable 
level of agreement between the envelope model and published data. Both of the
climate change scenarios, for each of the time periods, projected only slight to 
moderate increases in the average farm habitat suitability scores for all the
South Island regions. However, only for the West Coast, Marlborough, Tasman, and 
Nelson regions did these increases in environmental suitability translate into an
increased proportion of cattle farms with low or high H. longicornis habitat
suitability. These results will have important implications for the geographical 
progression of Theileria-associated bovine anaemia (TABA) in New Zealand and will
also be of interest to Haemaphysalis longicornis researchers in Australia, Japan,
Korea and New Zealand.

Perturbation of normal behaviors in honey bee colonies by any external factor can
immediately reduce the colony's capacity for brood rearing, which can eventually 
lead to colony collapse. To investigate the effects of brood-rearing suppression 
on the biology of honey bee workers, gene-set enrichment analysis of the
transcriptomes of worker bees with or without suppressed brood rearing was
performed. When brood rearing was suppressed, pathways associated with both
protein degradation and synthesis were simultaneously over-represented in both
nurses and foragers, and their overall pathway representation profiles resembled 
those of normal foragers and nurses, respectively. Thus, obstruction of normal
labor induced over-representation in pathways related with reshaping of worker
bee physiology, suggesting that transition of labor is physiologically
reversible. In addition, some genes associated with the regulation of neuronal
excitability, cellular and nutritional stress and aggressiveness were
over-expressed under brood rearing suppression perhaps to manage in-hive stress
under unfavorable conditions.

Information regarding the relationship between the incidence of foodborne
diseases (FBD) and climatic factors is useful in designing preventive strategies 
for FBD based on anticipated future climate change. To better predict the effect 
of climate change on foodborne pathogens, the present study investigated the
combined influence of multiple climatic factors on bacterial FBD incidence in
South Korea. During 2011-2015, the relationships between 8 climatic factors and
the incidences of 13 bacterial FBD, were determined based on inpatient stays, on 
a monthly basis using the Pearson correlation analyses, multicollinearity tests, 
principal component analysis (PCA), and the seasonal autoregressive integrated
moving average (SARIMA) modeling. Of the 8 climatic variables, the combination of
temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, insolation, and cloudiness was
significantly associated with salmonellosis (P<0.01), vibriosis (P<0.05), and
enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection (P<0.01). The combined
effects of snowfall, wind speed, duration of sunshine, and cloudiness were not
significant for these 3 FBD. Other FBD, including campylobacteriosis, were not
significantly associated with any combination of climatic factors. These findings
indicate that the relationships between multiple climatic factors and bacterial
FBD incidence can be valuable for the development of prediction models for future
patterns of diseases in response to changes in climate.

Overwhelming evidence has shown that, from the Industrial Revolution to the
present, human activities influence ground-level ozone (O3) concentrations. Past 
studies demonstrate links between O3 exposure and health. However, knowledge gaps
remain in our understanding concerning the impacts of climate change mitigation
policies on O3 concentrations and health. Using a hybrid downscaling approach, we
evaluated the separate impact of climate change and emission control policies on 
O3 levels and associated excess mortality in the US in the 2050s under two
Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). We show that, by the 2050s, under
RCP4.5, increased O3 levels due to combined climate change and emission control
policies, could contribute to an increase of approximately 50 premature deaths
annually nationwide in the US. The biggest impact, however, is seen under RCP8.5,
where rises in O3 concentrations are expected to result in over 2,200 additional 
premature deaths annually. The largest increases in O3 are seen in RCP8.5 in the 
Northeast, the Southeast, the Central, and the West regions of the US.
Additionally, when O3 increases are examined by climate change and emissions
contributions separately, the benefits of emissions mitigation efforts may
significantly outweigh the effects of climate change mitigation policies on
O3-related mortality.

Dengue fever is a tropical endemic disease; however, because of climate change,
it may become a problem in South Korea in the near future. Research on vaccines
for dengue fever and outbreak preparedness are currently insufficient. In
addition, because there are no appropriate animal models, controversial results
from vaccine efficacy assessments and clinical trials have been reported.
Therefore, to study the mechanism of dengue fever and test the immunogenicity of 
vaccines, an appropriate animal model is urgently needed. In addition to mouse
models, more suitable models using animals that can be humanized will need to be 
constructed. In this report, we look at the current status of model animal
construction and discuss which models require further development.

BACKGROUND: Although numerous studies have shown increased risk of mortality from
elevated temperatures for adults, limited studies have examined temperature's
effect on mortality for infants. Our study investigated the city-specific and
overall effects of ambient temperature on infant mortality in seven major cities 
in Korea, 2004-2007.
METHODS: Birth cohort using a linked birth and death records included 777,570
births with 557 all-cause deaths. We estimated city-specific hazard ratios for
each city using an extended Cox proportional hazards model with time-dependent
covariates. Then we combined city-specific hazard ratios to generate overall
hazard ratio across the seven cities using a Bayesian hierarchical model.
Stratified analyses were conducted by cause of death (total and SIDS), exposure
period (whole gestation, each trimester, lifetime, 1 month before death, and 2
weeks before death), sex, and maternal characteristics.
RESULTS: Overall across the cities, we found significantly positive associations 
between ambient temperature during 1 month before death or 2 weeks before death
and infant mortality from total or SIDS. The overall hazard ratio of infant
mortality from total deaths and SIDS for a 1°C increase during 1 month before
death was 1.52 (95% CI, 1.46-1.57) and 1.50 (95% CI, 1.35-1.66), respectively. We
also found suggestive evidence that some factors such as mother's age may modify 
the association.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have implications for establishment of policy to reduce
the risk of infant mortality from high ambient temperature under climate change.

The global diversity of airborne bacteria has not yet been studied, despite its
importance in human health and climate change. Here, we focused on the diversity 
of airborne bacteria and their correlations with meteorological/environmental
conditions in China, South Korea, and Japan. Beijing (China) had more diverse
airborne bacteria, followed by Seoul (South Korea) and Nagasaki (Japan), and
seasonal variations were observed. Beijing and Seoul had more diverse airborne
bacteria during the winter, whereas Nagasaki showed greater diversity during the 
summer. According to principal component analysis and Bray-Curtis similarity,
higher similarity was observed between Beijing and Seoul than between Seoul and
Nagasaki during all seasons except summer. Among meteorological/environmental
variables, temperature and humidity were highly correlated with the diversity of 
airborne bacteria on the measurement day, whereas wind speeds and the frequency
of northwest winds were highly correlated for 2-3-day moving averages. Thus,
proximity and resuspension could enhance bacterial diversity in East Asian
cities.

In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using ferric salts including FeCl3
and Fe(NO3)3 as extracting and oxidizing agents for a soil washing process to
remediate Pb-contaminated soils. We treated various Pb minerals including PbO,
PbCO3, Pb3(CO3)2(OH)2, PbSO4, PbS, and Pb5(PO4)3(OH) using ferric salts, and
compared our results with those obtained using common washing agents of HCl,
HNO3, disodium-ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (Na2-EDTA), and citric acid. The 
use of 50 mM Fe(NO3)3 extracted significantly more Pb (above 96% extraction) from
Pb minerals except PbSO4 (below 55% extraction) compared to the other washing
agents. In contrast, washing processes using FeCl3 and HCl were not effective for
extraction from Pb minerals because of PbCl2 precipitation. Yet, the newly formed
PbCl2 could be dissolved by subsequent wash with distilled water under acidic
conditions. When applying our washing method to remediate field-contaminated soil
from a shooting range that had high concentrations of Pb3(CO3)2(OH)2 and PbCO3,
we extracted more Pb (approximately 99% extraction) from the soil using 100 mM
Fe(NO3)3 than other washing agents at the same process conditions. Our results
show that ferric salts can be alternative washing agents for Pb-contaminated
soils in view of their extracting and oxidizing abilities.

In order to enhance in terms of accuracy and predict the modeling of the
potential distribution of species, the integration of using principal components 
of environmental variables as input of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) has been proposed
in this study. Principal components selected previously from the principal
component analysis results performed in ArcGIS in the environmental variables was
used as an input data of MaxEnt instead of raw data to model the potential
distribution of red spiny lobster from the year 1997 to 2015 and for three
different future scenarios 2020, 2050, and 2070. One set of six original
environmental variables pertaining to the years 1997-2015 and one set of four
variables for future scenarios were transformed independently into a single
multiband raster in ArcGIS in order to select the variables whose eigenvalues
explains more than 5% of the total variance with the purpose to use in the
modeling prediction in MaxEnt. The years 1997 and 1998 were chosen to compare the
accuracy of the model, showing better results using principal components instead 
of raw data in terms of area under the curve and partial receiver operating
characteristic as well as better predictions of suitable areas. Using principal
components as input of MaxEnt enhances the prediction of good habitat suitability
for red spiny lobster; however, future scenarios suggest an adequate management
by researches to elaborate appropriate guidelines for the conservation of the
habitat for this valuable specie with face to the climate change.

Observational analysis suggests that the western tropical Pacific (WTP) sea
surface temperature (SST) shows predominant variability over multidecadal time
scales, which is unlikely to be explained by the Interdecadal Pacific
Oscillation. Here we show that this variability is largely explained by the
remote Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO). A suite of Atlantic Pacemaker
experiments successfully reproduces the WTP multidecadal variability and the
AMO-WTP SST connection. The AMO warm SST anomaly generates an atmospheric
teleconnection to the North Pacific, which weakens the Aleutian low and
subtropical North Pacific westerlies. The wind changes induce a subtropical North
Pacific SST warming through wind-evaporation-SST effect, and in response to this 
warming, the surface winds converge towards the subtropical North Pacific from
the tropics, leading to anomalous cyclonic circulation and low pressure over the 
WTP region. The warm SST anomaly further develops due to the SST-sea level
pressure-cloud-longwave radiation positive feedback. Our findings suggest that
the Atlantic Ocean acts as a key pacemaker for the western Pacific decadal
climate variability.

The goal of this study is to investigate the wage differential between groups of 
workers who are exposed to heat and those who are not. Workers in the
heat-exposure risk group are defined as workers who work in conditions that cause
them to spend more than 25% of their work hours at high temperatures. To analyze 
the wage differential, the Blinder-Oaxaca and Juhn-Murphy-Pierce methods were
applied to Korea Working Condition Survey data. The results show that the no
heat-exposure risk group received higher wages. In most cases, this can be
interpreted as the endowment effect of human capital. As a price effect that
lowers the endowment effect, the compensating differential for the heat-exposure 
risk group was found to be 1%. Moreover, education level, work experience, and
employment status counteracted the compensating differentials for heat-exposure
risks. A comparison of data sets from 2011 and 2014 shows that the increasing
wage gap between the two groups was not caused by systematic social
discrimination factors. This study suggests that wage differential factors can be
modified for thermal environmental risks that will change working conditions as
the impact of climate change increases.

Peninsula, can be regarded as a strict ecological specialist, probably vulnerable
to anthropogenic environmental modifications and climate change. We used
mitochondrial cytochrome b gene to analyze the genetic diversity and phylogenetic
structure of O. koreanus from 19 populations collected in an attempt to cover its
major distribution within South Korea. A total of 76 haplotypes of O. koreanus
obtained in our analyses could be subdivided into three phylogenetic clades, KR, 
NE and SE. Clade KR haplotypes occur in most of the regions throughout the Korean
Peninsula with four distinct subclades (KR I-IV). Clade NE and SE haplotypes were
only observed in two populations YY and YS, respectively. Haplotype sharing was
scarce even among populations in geographical proximity, and most of the
populations were represented by a single clade or subclade, indicating the low
level of gene flow among populations. O. koreanus likely originated from the
historical southward dispersal of its ancestral lineages following divergence
from Chinese O. zhaoermii that was recovered as the sister of O. koreanus in our 
phylogenetic analysis. Our results have critical implications for the taxonomic
status of O. koreanus and its long-term management plan.

The exposure of the Earth's surface to the energetic input of rainfall is one of 
the key factors controlling water erosion. While water erosion is identified as
the most serious cause of soil degradation globally, global patterns of rainfall 
erosivity remain poorly quantified and estimates have large uncertainties. This
hampers the implementation of effective soil degradation mitigation and
restoration strategies. Quantifying rainfall erosivity is challenging as it
requires high temporal resolution(<30 min) and high fidelity rainfall recordings.
We present the results of an extensive global data collection effort whereby we
estimated rainfall erosivity for 3,625 stations covering 63 countries. This first
ever Global Rainfall Erosivity Database was used to develop a global erosivity
map at 30 arc-seconds(~1 km) based on a Gaussian Process Regression(GPR).
Globally, the mean rainfall erosivity was estimated to be 2,190 MJ mm ha(-1)
h(-1) yr(-1), with the highest values in South America and the Caribbean
countries, Central east Africa and South east Asia. The lowest values are mainly 
found in Canada, the Russian Federation, Northern Europe, Northern Africa and the
Middle East. The tropical climate zone has the highest mean rainfall erosivity
followed by the temperate whereas the lowest mean was estimated in the cold
climate zone.

Marine reptiles are declining globally, and recent climate change may be a
contributing factor. The study of sea snakes collected beyond their typical
distribution range provides valuable insight on how climate change affects marine
reptile populations. Recently, we collected 12 Laticauda semifasciata (11
females, 1 male) from the waters around southern South Korea-an area located
outside its typical distribution range (Japan, China including Taiwan,
Philippines and Indonesia). We investigated the genetic origin of Korean
specimens by analyzing mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (Cytb) sequences. Six
individuals shared haplotypes with a group found in Taiwan-southern Ryukyu
Islands, while the remaining six individuals shared haplotypes with a group
encompassing the entire Ryukyu Archipelago. These results suggest L. semifasciata
moved into Korean waters from the Taiwan-Ryukyu region via the Taiwan Warm
Current and/or the Kuroshio Current, with extended survival facilitated by ocean 
warming. We highlight several contributing factors that increase the chances that
L. semifasciata establishes new northern populations beyond the original
distribution range.

During algal bloom periods, operation of seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO)
pretreatment processes (e.g. ultrafiltration (UF)) has been hindered due to the
high concentration of algal cells and algal organic matter (AOM). The present
study evaluated for the first time the performance of titanium salts (i.e.
titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and polytitanium tetrachloride (PTC)) for the
removal of AOM in seawater and results were compared with the conventional FeCl3 
coagulant. Previous studies already demonstrated that titanium salts not only
provide a cost-effective alternative to conventional coagulants by producing a
valuable by-product but also minimise the environmental impact of sludge
production. Results from this study showed that both TiCl4 and PTC achieved
better performance than FeCl3 in terms of turbidity, UV254 and dissolved organic 
carbon (DOC) removal at similar coagulant dose. Liquid chromatography - organic
carbon detection (LC-OCD) was used to determine the removal of AOM compounds
based on their molecular weight (MW). This investigation revealed that both humic
substances and low MW organics were preferentially removed (i.e. up to 93%
removal) while all three coagulants showed poorer performance for the removal of 
high MW biopolymers (i.e. less than 50% removal). The detailed characterization
of flocs indicated that both titanium coagulants can grow faster, reach larger
size and present a more compact structure, which is highly advantageous for the
design of smaller and more compact mixing and sedimentation tanks. Both titanium 
coagulants also presented a higher ability to withstand shear force, which was
related to the higher amount of DOC adsorbed with the aggregated flocs. Finally, 
TiCl4 had a better recovery after breakage suggesting that charge neutralization 
may be the dominant mechanism for this coagulant, while the lower recovery of
both PTC and FeCl3 indicated that sweep flocculation is also a contributing
mechanism for the coagulation of AOM.

Paragonimiasis is highly prevalent endemic food-borne disease in Southeast Asia
and Latin America, and constitutes a major public health concern. A bibliometric 
analysis was performed about the worldwide scientific production of
paragonimiasis. We browsed in the Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-E)
(1957-2015), Scopus (1976-2015), Medline/PubMed/GoPubMed® (1970-2015), ScIELO
(1981-2014) and LILACS (1985-2011). All types of articles were included and
categorized by year of publication, number, type of scientific article, city and 
institution of origin, international cooperation, scientific journal, impact
factor, language of publication, authors and H index. In SCI-E, 1,028 manuscripts
were recovered, while Japan (21.9%) and the USA (17.7%) were the countries with
highest scientific production. In this database, Asian region studies received
5,454 citations (H index=32). In Scopus 2161 items were recovered, corresponding 
to 45.8% of Asian countries. Japan (18.2%) was the first with the University of
Miyazaki (11.7% of the country); South Korea (9.5%) was second with the Seoul
National University (11.2% of the country). In SciELO 29 items were found, with
no contributions from the Asian region. In LILACS 1487 articles were found (22.9%
covering Asia). Among the databases, the Journal of Parasitology (Impact
factor=1.227) showed the highest number of manuscripts and "Agatsuma T", from
Japan, was the author with most records. Japan and South Korea lead global
scientific production on paragonimiasis. By contrast, in Latin America,
production has been extremely low especially in the last five years.

The change of global-mean precipitation under global warming and interannual
variability is predominantly controlled by the change of atmospheric longwave
radiative cooling. Here we show that tightening of the ascending branch of the
Hadley Circulation coupled with a decrease in tropical high cloud fraction is key
in modulating precipitation response to surface warming. The magnitude of high
cloud shrinkage is a primary contributor to the intermodel spread in the changes 
of tropical-mean outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and global-mean precipitation 
per unit surface warming (dP/dTs) for both interannual variability and global
warming. Compared to observations, most Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project
Phase 5 models underestimate the rates of interannual tropical-mean dOLR/dTs and 
global-mean dP/dTs, consistent with the muted tropical high cloud shrinkage. We
find that the five models that agree with the observation-based interannual
dP/dTs all predict dP/dTs under global warming higher than the ensemble mean
dP/dTs from the ∼20 models analysed in this study.

OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were as follows: (1) to analyze the literature
systematically regarding the seasonal and monthly variation of the occurrence of 
episodes of acute gouty arthritis, and (2) to investigate the relationship
between the occurrence of episodes of acute gouty arthritis and meteorological
parameters.
METHODS: The present authors systematically reviewed databases for articles
published before November 2015. Studies with quantitative data on episodes of
acute gouty arthritis by months and/or seasons were included. Meteorological data
such as the highest temperature, lowest temperature, diurnal temperature range,
change in mean temperature between neighboring days, relative humidity and wind
speed for the geographic place(s), and study period where and when each study
took place were obtained from meteorological websites.
RESULTS: Ten studies published between 1920 and 2015 were included. A
meta-analysis by season showed that acute gouty arthritis occurred significantly 
more frequently in spring than in other seasons. Analysis by month showed an
increase in episodes of acute gouty arthritis from March to July, being the
highest in July. The trend reversed, and episodes of acute gouty arthritis
started decreasing from July to September, being the lowest in September. The
change in mean temperature between neighboring days was the only meteorological
parameter that was significantly correlated with the number of monthly episodes
of acute gouty arthritis.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute gouty arthritis seems to develop more frequently during the
period in which the temperature increases significantly between neighboring days:
spring by season and between March and July by month in the northern hemisphere.

Climate change causes permafrost thawing, and we are confronted with the
unpredictable risk of newly discovered permafrost microbes that have
disease-causing capabilities. Here, we first characterized the detailed chemical 
structure of the lipid A moiety from a Pseudomonas species that was isolated from
thawing arctic permafrost using MALDI-based mass spectrometric approaches (i.e., 
MALDI-TOF MS and MALDI-QIT-TOF MS(n)). The MALDI multi-stage mass spectrometry
(MS) analysis of lipid A extracted from the Pseudomonas sp. strain PAMC 28618
demonstrated that the hexaacyl lipid A ([M-H](-) at m/z 1616.5) contains a
glucosamine (GlcN) disaccharide backbone, two phosphates, four main acyl chains
and two branched acyl chains. Moreover, the lipid A molecule-based structural
activity relationship with other terrestrial Gram-negative bacteria indicated
that strain PAMC 28618 has an identical lipid A structure with the mesophilic
Pseudomonas cichorii which can cause rot disease in endive (Cichorium endivia)
and that their bacterial toxicities were equivalent. Therefore, the overall lipid
A validation process provides a general strategy for characterizing bacteria that
have been isolated from arctic permafrost and analyzing their respective
pathogenicities.

Climate change, air pollution and refugees have become key global challenges
threatening sustainability of lifestyles, economies and ecosystems. Agri-food
systems are the number one driver of environmental change. Livestock production
is the world's largest land user, responsible for half of greenhouse gas
emissions from agri-food systems, and the source of repeated health crises. Poor 
diets have become the number one cause of ill health. Recommendations for a
healthy diet emphasize plant-based food. Rapidly falling costs in information
technology, biotechnology, renewable energy and battery technology will disrupt
current energy and transportation systems and offer opportunities for responsible
meat production. Growing consumer interest in healthy food, combined with
innovative information systems, offer opportunities to create value through
quality control and consumer information in integrated value chains. Meat
scientists have a major role to play in the necessary transformation of global
agri-food systems towards a new model of green economic growth that is climate
resilient, sustainable and provides green jobs.

Allergic conjunctivitis (AC), which may be acute or chronic, is associated with
rhinitis in 30%-70% of affected individuals, hence the term allergic
rhinoconjunctivitis (AR/C). Seasonal and perennial AC is generally milder than
the more chronic and persistent atopic and vernal keratoconjunctivitis. Natural
allergens like house dust mites (HDM), temperate and subtropical grass and tree
pollen are important triggers that drive allergic inflammation in AC in the
Asia-Pacific region. Climate change, environmental tobacco smoke, pollutants
derived from fuel combustion, Asian dust storms originating from central/north
Asia and phthalates may also exacerbate AR/C. The Allergies in Asia Pacific study
and International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood provide
epidemiological data on regional differences in AR/C within the region. AC
significantly impacts the quality of life of both children and adults, and these 
can be measured by validated quality of life questionnaires on AR/C. Management
guidelines for AC involve a stepped approach depending on the severity of
disease, similar to that for allergic rhinitis and asthma. Topical calcineurin
inhibitors are effective in certain types of persistent AC, and sublingual
immunotherapy is emerging as an effective treatment option in AR/C to grass
pollen and HDM. Translational research predominantly from Japan and Korea
involving animal models are important for the potential development of targeted
pharmacotherapies for AC.

The growth in global methane (CH4) concentration, which had been ongoing since
the industrial revolution, stalled around the year 2000 before resuming globally 
in 2007. We evaluate the role of the hydroxyl radical (OH), the major CH4 sink,
in the recent CH4 growth. We also examine the influence of systematic
uncertainties in OH concentrations on CH4 emissions inferred from atmospheric
observations. We use observations of 1,1,1-trichloroethane (CH3CCl3), which is
lost primarily through reaction with OH, to estimate OH levels as well as CH3CC3 
emissions, which have uncertainty that previously limited the accuracy of OH
estimates. We find a 64-70% probability that a decline in OH has contributed to
the post-2007 methane rise. Our median solution suggests that CH4 emissions
increased relatively steadily during the late 1990s and early 2000s, after which 
growth was more modest. This solution obviates the need for a sudden
statistically significant change in total CH4 emissions around the year 2007 to
explain the atmospheric observations and can explain some of the decline in the
atmospheric (13)CH4/(12)CH4 ratio and the recent growth in C2H6 Our approach
indicates that significant OH-related uncertainties in the CH4 budget remain, and
we find that it is not possible to implicate, with a high degree of confidence,
rapid global CH4 emissions changes as the primary driver of recent trends when
our inferred OH trends and these uncertainties are considered.

In predicting the acid-forming potential of rock samples, a combination of
acid-base accounting (ABA) and net acid generation (NAG) tests has been commonly 
used. While simple and economical, this method sometimes shows low reliability
such as categorizing certain samples as uncertain (UC). ABA and NAG tests were
modified to selectively recover valid minerals in nature and substituted for the 
original tests. ABA test overestimated acid-producing capacity (in the case of
weathered samples) and acid-neutralizing capacity (in the case of
plagioclase-including samples) compared to the modified ABA test. NAG test
yielded lower NAG pH compared to modified NAG test for samples with high total C 
content and low total S content. By comparing the correlation coefficients
between acid generation amounts by the two evaluation methods, it was confirmed
that modified evaluation method (MEM) has a much higher reliability (R
(2) = 0.9582) than existing evaluation method (EEM) (R (2) = 0.5873). It was also
concluded that exploiting advantages of both EEM and MEM is recommended where EEM
is initially applied for general classification and a supplemented static test of
MEM is executed for the purpose of correcting the error of UC categorized
samples.

The effect of temperature on the rate of systemic infection of potatoes (Solanum 
tuberosum L. cv. Chu-Baek) by Potato virus Y (PVY) was studied in growth
chambers. Systemic infection of PVY was observed only within the temperature
range of 16°C to 32°C. Within this temperature range, the time required for a
plant to become infected systemically decreased from 14 days at 20°C to 5.7 days 
at 28°C. The estimated lower thermal threshold was 15.6°C and the thermal
constant was 65.6 degree days. A systemic infection model was constructed based
on experimental data, using the infection rate (Lactin-2 model) and the infection
distribution (three-parameter Weibull function) models, which accurately
described the completion rate curves to systemic infection and the cumulative
distributions obtained in the PVY-potato system, respectively. Therefore, this
model was useful to predict the progress of systemic infections by PVY in potato 
plants, and to construct the epidemic models.

We have investigated short and small RNAs (sRNAs) that were bound to a
biologically active hexahistidine-tagged Potato virus Y (PVY) HCPro suppressor of
silencing, expressed from a heterologous virus vector in Nicotiana benthamiana
plants, and purified under nondenaturing conditions. We found that RNAs in
purified preparations were differentially enriched in 21-nucleotide (nt) and, to 
a much lesser extent, 22-nt sRNAs of viral sequences (viral sRNAs [vsRNAs])
compared to those found in a control plant protein background bound to nickel
resin in the absence of HCPro or in a purified HCPro alanine substitution mutant 
(HCPro mutB) control that lacked suppressor-of-silencing activity. In both
controls, sRNAs were composed almost entirely of molecules of plant sequence,
indicating that the resin-bound protein background had no affinity for vsRNAs and
also that HCPro mutB failed to bind to vsRNAs. Therefore, PVY HCPro suppressor
activity correlated with its ability to bind to 21- and 22-nt vsRNAs. HCPro
constituted at least 54% of the total protein content in purified preparations,
and we were able to calculate its contribution to the 21- and the 22-nt pools of 
sRNAs present in the purified samples and its binding strength relative to the
background. We also found that in the 21-nt vsRNAs of the HCPro preparation,
5'-terminal adenines were overrepresented relative to the controls, but this was 
not observed in vsRNAs of other sizes or of plant sequences.IMPORTANCE It was
previously shown that HCPro can bind to long RNAs and small RNAs (sRNAs) in vitro
and, in the case of Turnip mosaic virus HCPro, also in vivo in arabidopsis
AGO2-deficient plants. Our data show that PVY HCPro binds in vivo to sRNAs during
infection in wild-type Nicotiana benthamiana plants when expressed from a
heterologous virus vector. Using a suppression-of-silencing-deficient HCPro
mutant that can accumulate in this host when expressed from a virus vector, we
also show that sRNA binding correlates with silencing suppression activity. We
demonstrate that HCPro binds at least to sRNAs with viral sequences of 21
nucleotides (nt) and, to a much lesser extent, of 22 nt, which were are also
differentially enriched in 5'-end adenines relative to the purified controls.
Together, our results support the physical binding of HCPro to vsRNAs of 21 and
22 nt as a means to interfere with antiviral silencing.

Objective: Strategies to promote patient involvement in medical error prevention 
have been implemented, but little is known about the effects of education on
changes in perceptions and attitudes about patients' own safety.
Design: We administered a survey to military personnel admitted to the Armed
Forces Capital Hospital. Responses were classified according to perception and
attitude.
Setting: Single military hospital in Korea.
Participants: A total of 483 completed surveys were included in our study; 252 of
the respondents received safety education at admission.
Methods: We provided educational program material to one-half of the patients at 
admission (intervention group). The other one-half of patients received no safety
education (non-intervention group). We then performed two rounds of a
self-administered survey, based on whether the patient received patient safety
education. Cronbach's alpha was calculated to determine scale score reliability. 
Regression analysis was used to evaluate associations between education and
change in scores.
Results: Scores for perception and attitude were greater in the intervention
group. The results of the regression analysis revealed that compared with the
non-intervention respondents, the respondents who received education had higher
perception (estimate: 7.809, P < 0.0001) and attitude scores (estimate: 5.539, P 
< 0.0001).
Conclusion: Our study results suggested that patient education was associated
with higher scores in both perception and attitudes about safety. To improve
patient engagement in this area, efficient methods that encourage patient
empowerment should be developed. Specialized health care providers who provide
patient level education are needed to achieve a satisfactory patient safety
climate.

Background: The Antarctic intertidal zone is continuously subjected to extremely 
fluctuating biotic and abiotic stressors. The West Antarctic Peninsula is the
most rapidly warming region on Earth. Organisms living in Antarctic intertidal
pools are therefore interesting for research into evolutionary adaptation to
extreme environments and the effects of climate change.
Findings: We report the whole genome sequence of the Antarctic-endemic
harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus kingsejongensi . The 37 Gb raw DNA sequence was
generated using the Illumina Miseq platform. Libraries were prepared with 65-fold
coverage and a total length of 295 Mb. The final assembly consists of 48 368
contigs with an N50 contig length of 17.5 kb, and 27 823 scaffolds with an N50
contig length of 159.2 kb. A total of 12 772 coding genes were inferred using the
MAKER annotation pipeline. Comparative genome analysis revealed that T.
kingsejongensis -specific genes are enriched in transport and metabolism
processes. Furthermore, rapidly evolving genes related to energy metabolism
showed positive selection signatures.
Conclusions: The T. kingsejongensis genome provides an interesting example of an 
evolutionary strategy for Antarctic cold adaptation, and offers new genetic
insights into Antarctic intertidal biota.

Understanding the evolutionary processes that have created diversity and the
genetic potential of species to adapt to environmental change is an important
premise for biodiversity conservation. Herein, we used mitochondrial trnW-L and
cox3 and plastid rbcL-S data sets to analyze population genetic variation and
phylogeographic history of the brown alga Sargassum fusiforme, whose natural
resource has been largely exterminated in the Asia-Northwest Pacific in the past 
decades. Phylogenetic trees and network analysis consistently revealed three
major haplotype groups (A, B, and C) in S. fusiforme, with A and B distributed in
the Japan-Pacific coast. Group C consisted of three subgroups (C1, C2, and C3)
which were distributed in the Sea of Japan, the Yellow-Bohai Sea, and East China 
Sea, respectively. Isolation-with-migration (IM a) analysis revealed that the
three groups diverged approximately during the mid-Pleistocene (c. 756-1,224 ka).
Extended Bayesian skyline plots (EBSP) showed that groups A and B underwent
relatively long-term stable population size despite a subsequent rapid
demographic expansion, while subgroups C2 and C3 underwent a sudden expansion at 
c. 260 ka. FST and AMOVA detected low population-level genetic variation and high
degrees of divergence between groups. The cryptic diversity and phylogeographic
patterns found in S. fusiforme not only are essential to understand how
environmental shifts and evolutionary processes shaped diversity and distribution
of coastal seaweeds but also provide additional insights for conserving and
managing seaweed resources and facilitate predictions of their responses to
future climate change and habitat loss.

Understanding shifts in autumn phenology associated with climate changes is
critical for preserving forest ecosystems. This study examines the changes in the
leaf coloring date (LCD) of two temperate deciduous tree species, Acer palmatum
(Acer) and Ginkgo biloba (Ginkgo), in response to surface air temperature (Ts)
changes at 54 stations of South Korea for the period 1989-2007. The variations of
Acer and Ginkgo in South Korea are very similar: they show the same mean LCD of
295th day of the year and delays of about 0.45 days year-1 during the observation
period. The delaying trend is closely correlated (correlation coefficient > 0.77)
with increases in Ts in mid-autumn by 2.8 days °C-1. It is noted that the LCD
delaying and temperature sensitivity (days °C-1) for both tree species show
negligible dependences on latitudes and elevations. Given the significant LCD-Ts 
relation, we project LCD changes for 2016-35 and 2046-65 using a process-based
model forced by temperature from climate model simulation. The projections
indicate that the mean LCD would be further delayed by 3.2 (3.7) days in 2016-35 
(2046-65) due to mid-autumn Ts increases. This study suggests that the mid-autumn
warming is largely responsible for the observed LCD changes in South Korea and
will intensify the delaying trends in the future.

Salt marshes are unique ecosystem of which a microbial community is expected to
be affected by global climate change. In this study, by using T-RFLP analysis,
quantitative PCR, and pyrosequencing, we comprehensively analyzed the microbial
community structure responding to elevated CO2 (eCO2) and N addition in a salt
marsh ecosystem subjected to CO2 manipulation and N addition for about 3 years.
We focused on the genes of microbes relevant to N-cycling (denitrification and
nitrification), CH4-flux (methanogens and methanotrophs), and S-cycling (sulfate 
reduction) considering that they are key functional groups involved in the
nutrient cycle of salt marsh system. Overall, this study suggests that (1) eCO2
and N addition affect functional microbial community involved in greenhouse gas
flux in salt marsh system. Specifically, the denitrification process may be
facilitated, while the methanogenesis may be impeded due to the outcompeting of
sulfate reduction by eCO2 and N. This implies that future global change may cause
a probable change in GHGs flux and positive feedback to global climate change in 
salt marsh; (2) the effect of eCO2 and N on functional group seems specific and
to contrast with each other, but the effect of single factor would not be
compromised but complemented by combination of two factors. (3) The response of
functional groups to eCO2 and/or N may be directly or indirectly related to the
plant community and its response to eCO2 and/or N. This study provides new
insights into our understanding of functional microbial community responses to
eCO2 and/or N addition in a C3/C4 plant mixed salt marsh system.

Current status and conservation implications for future management.

Seagrasses provide numerous ecosystem services for coastal and estuarine
environments, such as nursery functions, erosion protection, pollution
filtration, and carbon sequestration. Zostera marina (common name "eelgrass") is 
one of the seagrass bed-forming species distributed widely in the northern
hemisphere, including the Korean Peninsula. Recently, however, there has been a
drastic decline in the population size of Z. marina worldwide, including Korea.
We examined the current population genetic status of this species on the southern
coast of Korea by estimating the levels of genetic diversity and genetic
structure of 10 geographic populations using eight nuclear microsatellite
markers. The level of genetic diversity was found to be significantly lower for
populations on Jeju Island [mean allelic richness (AR) = 1.92, clonal diversity
(R) = 0.51], which is located approximately 155 km off the southernmost region of
the Korean Peninsula, than for those in the South Sea (mean AR = 2.69, R = 0.82),
which is on the southern coast of the mainland. South Korean eelgrass populations
were substantially genetically divergent from one another (FST = 0.061-0.573),
suggesting that limited contemporary gene flow has been taking place among
populations. We also found weak but detectable temporal variation in genetic
structure within a site over 10 years. In additional depth comparisons,
statistically significant genetic differentiation was observed between shallow
(or middle) and deep zones in two of three sites tested. Depleted genetic
diversity, small effective population sizes (Ne) and limited connectivity for
populations on Jeju Island indicate that these populations may be vulnerable to
local extinction under changing environmental conditions, especially given that
Jeju Island is one of the fastest warming regions around the world. Overall, our 
work will inform conservation and restoration efforts, including transplantation 
for eelgrass populations at the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula, for this
ecologically important species.

The main purpose of this research was to evaluate the geochemical properties of
rocks for a single indicator of acid-forming potential. The indicators, such as
net acid generation (NAG), NAG pH and total S, were applied to 312 rock samples
of various geological characteristics. Additional indicators, such as a Modified 
NAG pH, paste pH and available acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), were applied to 
22 selected samples. Among them, NAG pH was considered the most plausible single 
indicator in evaluating acid-forming potential, as it is simple to measure,
widely applicable to various samples and can be used to estimate the NAG value.
The acid-forming potential of 287 samples (92% of samples examined in this
research) was classified as either non-acid forming (NAF) or potentially acid
forming (PAF) by NAG pH, with an NAF criteria of <3.21 and PAF of >4.52. The NAG 
pH was also a good estimate of the risk of short-term acid release when combined 
with paste pH information. However, application of NAG pH to coal mine wastes,
with high organic carbon contents, produced erroneous results due to the
generation of organic acid during the NAG test. In this research, a Modified NAG 
pH was assessed as an alternative to NAG pH in such situations.

Excess consumption of energy by humans is compounded by environmental pollution, 
the greenhouse effect and climate change impacts. Current developments in the use
of algae for bioenergy production offer several advantages. Algal biomass is
hence considered a new bio-material which holds the promise to fulfil the rising 
demand for energy. Microalgae are used in effluents treatment, bioenergy
production, high value added products synthesis and CO2 capture. This review
summarizes the potential applications of algae in bioelectrochemically mediated
oxidation reactions in fully biotic microbial fuel cells for power generation and
removal of unwanted nutrients. In addition, this review highlights the recent
developments directed towards developing different types of microalgae MFCs. The 
different process factors affecting the performance of microalgae MFC system and 
some technological bottlenecks are also addressed.

BACKGROUND: Climate change could increase the number of regions affected by
meteorologic disasters. Meteorologic disasters can increase the risk of
infectious disease outbreaks, including waterborne and foodborne diseases.
Although many outbreaks of waterborne diseases after single disasters have been
analyzed, there have not been sufficient studies reporting comprehensive analyses
of cases occurring during long-term surveillance after multiple disasters, which 
could provide evidence of whether meteorologic disasters cause infectious disease
outbreaks.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the nationwide short-term changes in
waterborne and foodborne disease incidences after a meteorologic disaster.
METHODS: We analyzed cases after all 65 floods and typhoons between 2001 and 2009
using the Korean National Emergency Management Agency's reports. Based on these
data, we compared the weekly incidences of Vibrio vulnificus septicemia (VVS),
shigellosis, typhoid fever, and paratyphoid fever before, during, and after the
disasters, using multivariate Poisson regression models. We also analyzed the
interactions between disaster characteristics and the relative risk of each
disease.
FINDINGS: Compared with predisaster incidences, the incidences of VVS and
shigellosis were 2.49-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.47-4.22) and 3.10-fold
(95% confidence interval, 1.21-7.92) higher, respectively, the second week after 
the disaster. The incidences of VVS and shigellosis peaked the second week
postdisaster and subsequently decreased. The risks of typhoid and paratyphoid
fever did not significantly increase throughout the 4 weeks postdisaster. The
daily average precipitation interacted with VVS and shigellosis incidences,
whereas disaster type only interacted with VVS incidence patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidences of VVS and shigellosis were associated with
meteorologic disasters, and disaster characteristics were associated with the
disease incidence patterns postdisaster. These findings provide important
comprehensive evidence to develop and support policies for managing and
protecting public health after meteorologic disasters.

Over the last several decades, the frequent occurrence of algal bloom in drinking
water supplies, driven by increasing anthropogenic input and climate change, has 
posed serious problems for membrane filtration processes, resulting in reduced
membrane permeability and increased energy consumption. It is essential to
comprehensively understand the characteristics of algal dissolved organic matter 
(DOM) and the subsequent effects on the filtration processes for better insight
into membrane fouling mitigation. Many studies have revealed that algal DOM has
displayed unique characteristics distinguished from other sources of DOM with
respect to the chemical composition, the structures, and the molecular weight
distributions. Algal DOM is considered to be a major obstacle in understanding
membrane fouling due to its complicated interactions among dissimilar algal DOM
constituents as well as between algal DOM and membrane material matrices. The
present review article summarizes (1) recent characterizing methods for algal
DOM, (2) environmental factors affecting the characteristics of algal DOM, (3)
the discrepancies between algal DOM and other sources of aquatic DOM,
particularly terrestrial sources, and (4) potential fouling effects of algal DOM 
on membrane filtration processes and their associations with algal DOM
characteristics. A broad understanding of algal DOM-driven membrane fouling can
lead to breakthroughs in efficient membrane filtration processes to treat algal
bloom water sources.

Aerosolized microorganisms may play an important role in climate change, disease 
transmission, water and soil contaminants, and geographic migration of microbes. 
While it is known that bioaerosols are generated when bubbles break on the
surface of water containing microbes, it is largely unclear how viable soil-based
microbes are transferred to the atmosphere. Here we report a previously unknown
mechanism by which rain disperses soil bacteria into the air. Bubbles, tens of
micrometres in size, formed inside the raindrops disperse micro-droplets
containing soil bacteria during raindrop impingement. A single raindrop can
transfer 0.01% of bacteria on the soil surface and the bacteria can survive more 
than one hour after the aerosol generation process. This work further reveals
that bacteria transfer by rain is highly dependent on the regional soil profile
and climate conditions.

The atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) level is expected to increase substantially,
which may change the global climate and carbon dynamics in ecosystems. We
examined the effects of an elevated atmospheric CO2 level on the growth of
Quercus acutissima and Fraxinus rhynchophylla seedlings. We investigated changes 
in the chemical composition of leaf litter, as well as litter decomposition. Q.
acutissima and F. rhynchophylla did not show differences in dry weight between
ambient CO2 and enriched CO2 treatments, but they exhibited different patterns of
carbon allocation, namely, lower shoot/root ratio (S/R) and decreased specific
leaf area (SLA) under CO2-enriched conditions. The elevated CO2 concentration
significantly reduced the nitrogen concentration in leaf litter while increasing 
lignin concentrations and carbon/nitrogen (C/N) and lignin/N ratios. The
microbial biomass associated with decomposing Q. acutissima leaf litter was
suppressed in CO2 enrichment chambers, while that of F. rhynchophylla was not.
The leaf litter of Q. acutissima from the CO2-enriched chambers, in contrast with
F. rhynchophylla, contained much lower nutrient concentrations than that of the
litter in the ambient air chambers. Consequently, poorer litter quality
suppressed decomposition.

The coastal ecosystems are considered as one of the most dynamic and vulnerable
environments under various anthropogenic developments and the effects of climate 
change. Variations in the composition and diversity of microbial communities may 
be a good indicator for determining whether the marine ecosystems are affected by
complex forcing stressors. DNA sequence-based metagenomics has recently emerged
as a promising tool for analyzing the structure and diversity of microbial
communities based on environmental DNA (eDNA). However, few studies have so far
been performed using this approach to assess the impacts of human activities on
the microbial communities in marine systems. In this study, using metagenomic DNA
sequencing (16S ribosomal RNA gene), we analyzed and compared seawater and
sediment communities between sand mining and control (natural) sites in southern 
coastal waters of Korea to assess whether anthropogenic activities have
significantly affected the microbial communities. The sand mining sites harbored 
considerably lower levels of microbial diversities in the surface seawater
community during spring compared with control sites. Moreover, the sand mining
areas had distinct microbial taxonomic group compositions, particularly during
spring season. The microbial groups detected solely in the sediment load/dredging
areas (e.g., Marinobacter, Alcanivorax, Novosphingobium) are known to be involved
in degradation of toxic chemicals such as hydrocarbon, oil, and aromatic
compounds, and they also contain potential pathogens. This study highlights the
versatility of metagenomics in monitoring and diagnosing the impacts of human
disturbance on the environmental health of marine ecosystems from eDNA.

Recent improvements in the theoretical understanding of the relationship between 
tropical cyclones (TCs) and their large-scale environments have resulted in
significant improvements in the skill for forecasting TC activity at daily and
seasonal time-scales. However, future changes in TC activity under a warmer
climate remain uncertain, particularly in terms of TC genesis locations and
subsequent pathways. Applying a track-pattern-based statistical model to 22
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) model runs for the
historical period and the future period corresponding to the Representative
Concentration Pathway 8.5 emissions scenarios, this study shows that in future
climate conditions, TC passage frequency will decrease over the North Atlantic,
particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, but will increase over the western North
Pacific, especially that hits Korea and Japan. Unlike previous studies based on
fine-resolution models, an ensemble mean of CMIP5 models projects an increase in 
TC activity in the western North Pacific, which is owing to enhanced subtropical 
deep convection and favorable dynamic conditions therein in conjunction with the 
expansion of the tropics and vice versa for the North Atlantic. Our results
suggest that North America will experience less TC landfalls, while northeast
Asia will experience more TCs than in the present-day climate.

Bioaerosols significantly affect atmospheric processes while they undergo
long-range vertical and horizontal transport and influence atmospheric chemistry 
and physics and climate change. Accumulating evidence suggests that exposure to
bioaerosols may cause adverse health effects, including severe disease. Studies
of bioaerosols have primarily focused on their chemical composition and largely
neglected their biological composition and the negative effects of biological
composition on ecosystems and human health. Here, current molecular methods for
the identification, quantification, and distribution of bioaerosol agents are
reviewed. Modern developments in environmental microbiology technology would be
favorable in elucidation of microbial temporal and spatial distribution in the
atmosphere at high resolution. In addition, these provide additional supports for
growing evidence that microbial diversity or composition in the bioaerosol is an 
indispensable environmental aspect linking with public health.

We examine the impact of current and future climate on crop mixes over space in
the US. We find using historical data that temperature and precipitation are
among the causal factors for shits in crop production location and mixes, with
some crops being more sensitive than others. In particular, we find that when
temperature rises, cotton, rice, sorghum and winter wheat are more likely to be
chosen. We also find that barley, sorghum, winter wheat, spring wheat and hay are
more likely to be chosen as regions become drier, and corn, cotton, rice and
soybeans are more likely to be selected in wetter regions. Additionally, we
assess how much of the observed crop mix shifts between 1970 and 2010 were
contributed to by climate change. There we find climate explains about 7-50% of
the shift in latitude, 20-36% in longitude and 4-28% of that in elevation.
Finally, we estimate climate change impacts on future crop mix under CMIP5
scenarios. There we find shifts in US production regions for almost all major
crops with the movement north and east. The estimates describe how the farmers
respond to altering climate and can be used for planning future crop allocations.

The soil microbiome is important for the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems.
However, the impacts of climate on taxonomic and functional diversity of soil
microbiome are not well understood. A precipitation gradient along regional scale
transects may offer a model setting for understanding the effect of climate on
the composition and function of the soil microbiome. Here, we compared taxonomic 
and functional attributes of soil microorganisms in arid, semiarid,
Mediterranean, and humid Mediterranean climatic conditions of Israel using
shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We hypothesized that there would be a distinct
taxonomic and functional soil community for each precipitation zone, with arid
environments having lower taxonomic and functional diversity, greater relative
abundance of stress response and sporulation-related genes, and lower relative
abundance of genes related to nutrient cycling and degradation of complex organic
compounds. As hypothesized, our results showed a distinct taxonomic and
functional community in each precipitation zone, revealing differences in soil
taxonomic and functional selection in the different climates. Although the
taxonomic diversity remained similar across all sites, the functional diversity
was-as hypothesized-lower in the arid environments, suggesting that functionality
is more constrained in "extreme" environments. Also, with increasing aridity, we 
found a significant increase in genes related to dormancy/sporulation and a
decrease in those related to nutrient cycling (genes related to nitrogen,
potassium, and sulfur metabolism), respectively. However, relative abundance of
genes related to stress response were lower in arid soils. Overall, these results
indicate that climatic conditions play an important role in shaping taxonomic and
functional attributes of soil microbiome. These findings have important
implications for understanding the impacts of climate change (e.g., precipitation
change) on structure and function of the soil microbiome.

Mesodinium rubrum Lohmann is a mixotrophic ciliate and one of the best studied
species exhibiting acquired phototrophy. To investigate the fate of cryptophyte
organelles in the ciliate subjected to starvation, we conducted ultrastructural
studies of a Korean strain of M. cf. rubrum during a 10 week starvation
experiments. Ingested cells of the cryptophyte Teleaulax amphioxeia were first
enveloped by ciliate membrane, and then prey organelles, including ejectisomes,
flagella, basal bodies and flagellar roots, were digested. Over time, prey nuclei
protruded into the cytoplasm of the ciliate, their size and volume increased, and
their number decreased, suggesting that the cryptophyte nuclei likely fused with 
each other in the ciliate cytoplasm. At 4 weeks of starvation, M. cf. rubrum
cells without cryptophyte nuclei started to appear. At 10 weeks of starvation,
only two M. cf. rubrum cells still possessing a cryptophyte nucleus had
relatively intact chloroplast-mitochondria complexes (CMCs), while M. cf. rubrum 
cells without cryptophyte nuclei had a few damaged CMCs. This is the first
ultrastructural study demonstrating that cryptophyte nuclei undergo a dramatic
change inside M. cf. rubrum in terms of size, shape, and number following their
acquisition.

We developed a model, termed D-PSA-K, to estimate the accumulated potential
damage on kiwifruit canes caused by bacterial canker during the growing and
overwintering seasons. The model consisted of three parts including estimation of
the amount of necrotic lesion in a non-frozen environment, the rate of necrosis
increase in a freezing environment during the overwintering season, and the
amount of necrotic lesion on kiwifruit canes caused by bacterial canker during
the overwintering and growing seasons. We evaluated the model's accuracy by
comparing the observed maximum disease incidence on kiwifruit canes against the
damage estimated using weather and disease data collected at Wando during
1994-1997 and at Seogwipo during 2014-2015. For the Hayward cultivar, D-PSA-K
estimated the accumulated damage as approximately nine times the observed maximum
disease incidence. For the Hort16A cultivar, the accumulated damage estimated by 
D-PSA-K was high when the observed disease incidence was high. D-PSA-K could
assist kiwifruit growers in selecting optimal sites for kiwifruit cultivation and
establishing improved production plans by predicting the loss in kiwifruit
production due to bacterial canker, using past weather or future climate change
data.

The microbiome in the rhizosphere-the region surrounding plant roots-plays a key 
role in plant growth and health, enhancing nutrient availability and protecting
plants from biotic and abiotic stresses. To assess bacterial diversity in the
tomato rhizosphere, we performed two contrasting approaches: culture-dependent
and -independent. In the culture-dependent approach, two culture media
(Reasoner's 2A agar and soil extract agar) were supplemented with 12 antibiotics 
for isolating diverse bacteria from the tomato rhizosphere by inhibiting
predominant bacteria. A total of 689 bacterial isolates were clustered into 164
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% sequence similarity, and these were
found to belong to five bacterial phyla (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria,
Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, and Firmicutes). Of these, 122 OTUs were retrieved 
from the antibiotic-containing media, and 80 OTUs were recovered by one specific 
antibiotic-containing medium. In the culture-independent approach, we conducted
Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and obtained 19,215
high-quality sequences, which clustered into 478 OTUs belonging to 16 phyla.
Among the total OTUs from the MiSeq dataset, 22% were recovered in the culture
collection, whereas 41% of OTUs in the culture collection were not captured by
MiSeq sequencing. These results showed that antibiotics were effective in
isolating various taxa that were not readily isolated on antibiotic-free media,
and that both contrasting approaches provided complementary information to
characterize bacterial diversity in the tomato rhizosphere.

organic matter decomposition, nutrient cycling, and plant nutrient availability. 
The land use for greenhouse cultivation has been increasing continuously, which
involves an intensive input of agricultural materials to enhance productivity;
however, relatively little is known about bacterial communities in greenhouse
soils. To assess the effects of environmental factors on the soil bacterial
diversity and community composition, a total of 187 greenhouse soil samples
collected across Korea were subjected to bacterial 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing
analysis. A total of 11,865 operational taxonomic units at a 97% similarity
cutoff level were detected from 847,560 sequences. Among nine soil factors
evaluated; pH, electrical conductivity (EC), exchangeable cations (Ca(2+),
Mg(2+), Na(+), and K(+)), available P2O5, organic matter, and NO3-N, soil pH was 
most strongly correlated with bacterial richness (polynomial regression, pH: R(2)
= 0.1683, P < 0.001) and diversity (pH: R(2) = 0.1765, P < 0.001). Community
dissimilarities (Bray-Curtis distance) were positively correlated with Euclidean 
distance for pH and EC (Mantel test, pH: r = 0.2672, P < 0.001; EC: r = 0.1473, P
< 0.001). Among dominant phyla (> 1%), the relative abundances of Proteobacteria,
Gemmatimonadetes, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes
were also more strongly correlated with pH and EC values, compared with other
soil cation contents, such as Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Na(+), and K(+). Our results
suggest that, despite the heterogeneity of various environmental variables, the
bacterial communities of the intensively cultivated greenhouse soils were
particularly influenced by soil pH and EC. These findings therefore shed light on
the soil microbial ecology of greenhouse cultivation, which should be helpful for
devising effective management strategies to enhance soil microbial diversity and 
improving crop productivity.

Sea ice loss is accelerating in the Barents and Kara Seas (BKS). Assessing
potential linkages between sea ice retreat/thinning and the region's ancient and 
unique social-ecological systems is a pressing task. Tundra nomadism remains a
vitally important livelihood for indigenous Nenets and their large reindeer
herds. Warming summer air temperatures have been linked to more frequent and
sustained summer high-pressure systems over West Siberia, Russia, but not to sea 
ice retreat. At the same time, autumn/winter rain-on-snow (ROS) events have
become more frequent and intense. Here, we review evidence for autumn atmospheric
warming and precipitation increases over Arctic coastal lands in proximity to BKS
ice loss. Two major ROS events during November 2006 and 2013 led to massive
winter reindeer mortality episodes on the Yamal Peninsula. Fieldwork with
migratory herders has revealed that the ecological and socio-economic impacts
from the catastrophic 2013 event will unfold for years to come. The suggested
link between sea ice loss, more frequent and intense ROS events and high reindeer
mortality has serious implications for the future of tundra Nenets nomadism.

To investigate the role of ω-3 fatty acid (FA) desaturase (FAD8) during cold
acclimation in higher plants, we characterized three independent T-DNA
insertional knock-out mutants of OsFAD8 from rice (Oryza sativa L.). At room
temperature (28 °C), osfad8 plants exhibited significant alterations in fatty
acid (FA) unsaturation for all four investigated plastidic lipid classes. During 
a 5-d acclimation period at 4 °C, further changes in FA unsaturation in both
wild-type (WT) and mutant plants varied according to the type of lipid. We also
monitored the fluidity of the thylakoid membrane using a threshold temperature to
represent the change in fluorescence. The values were altered significantly by
both FAD8 mutation and cold acclimation, suggesting that factors other than FAD8 
are involved in C18 FA unsaturation and fluctuations in membrane fluidity.
Similarly, significant changes were noted for both the mutant and WT samples in
terms of their FA compositions as well as activities related to photosystem (PS) 
I, PSII, and photoprotection. This included the development of non-photochemical 
quenching and increased zeaxanthin accumulation. Despite the relatively small
changes in FA composition during cold acclimation, cold-inducible FAD8 knock-out 
mutants displayed strong differences in photoprotective activities and a further 
drop in membrane fluidity. The mutants were more sensitive than WT to short-term 
low-temperature stress that resulted in increased production of reactive oxygen
species after 5 d of chilling. Taken together, our findings suggest that FA
unsaturation by OsFAD8 is crucial for the acclimation of higher plants to
low-temperature stress.

Increased temperature means and fluctuations associated with climate change are
predicted to exert profound effects on the seed yield of soybean. We conducted an
experiment to evaluate the impacts of global warming on the phenology and yield
of two determinate soybean cultivars in a temperate region (37.27°N, 126.99°E;
Suwon, South Korea). These two soybean cultivars, Sinpaldalkong [maturity group
(MG) IV] and Daewonkong (MG VI), were cultured on various sowing dates within a
four-year period, under no water-stress conditions. Soybeans were kept in
greenhouses controlled at the current ambient temperature (AT), AT+1.5°C,
AT+3.0°C, and AT+5.0°C throughout the growth periods. Growth periods (VE-R7) were
significantly prolonged by the elevated temperatures, especially the R1-R5
period. Cultivars exhibited no significant differences in seed yield at the
AT+1.5°C and AT+3.0°C treatments, compared to AT, while a significant yield
reduction was observed at the AT+5.0°C treatment. Yield reductions resulted from 
limited seed number, which was due to an overall low numbers of pods and seeds
per pod. Heat stress conditions induced a decrease in pod number to a greater
degree than in seed number per pod. Individual seed weight exhibited no
significant variation among temperature elevation treatments; thus, seed weight
likely had negligible impacts on overall seed yield. A boundary line analysis
(using quantile regression) estimated optimum temperatures for seed number at
26.4 to 26.8°C (VE-R5) for both cultivars; the optimum temperatures (R5-R7) for
single seed weight were estimated at 25.2°C for the Sinpaldalkong smaller-seeded 
cultivar, and at 22.3°C for the Daewonkong larger-seeded cultivar. The optimum
growing season (VE-R7) temperatures for seed yield, which were estimated by
combining the two boundary lines for seed number and seed weight, were 26.4 and
25.0°C for the Sinpaldalkong and Daewonkong cultivars, respectively. Considering 
the current soybean growing season temperature, which ranges from 21.7 (in the
north) to 24.6°C (in the south) in South Korea, and the temperature response of
potential soybean yields, further warming of less than approximately 1°C would
not become a critical limiting factor for soybean production in South Korea.

The goal of this study was to estimate the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG),
namely methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2) from poultry 
and pig production in South Korea over the last 10 years (2005 through 2014). The
calculations of GHG emissions were based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) guidelines. Over the study period, the CH4 emission from manure
management decreased in layer chickens, nursery to finishing pigs and gestating
to lactating sows, but there was a gradual increase in CH4 emission from broiler 
chickens and male breeding pigs. Both sows and nursery to finishing pigs were
associated with greater emissions from enteric fermentation than the boars,
especially in 2009. Layer chickens produced lower direct and indirect N2O
emissions from 2009 to 2014, whereas the average direct and indirect N2O
emissions from manure management for broiler chickens were 12.48 and 4.93 Gg
CO2-eq/yr, respectively. Annual direct and indirect N2O emissions for broiler
chickens tended to decrease in 2014. Average CO2 emission from direct on-farm
energy uses for broiler and layer chickens were 46.62 and 136.56 Gg CO2-eq/yr,
respectively. For pig sectors, the N2O emission from direct and indirect sources 
gradually increased, but they decreased for breeding pigs. Carbon dioxide
emission from direct on-farm energy uses reached a maximum of 53.93 Gg CO2-eq/yr 
in 2009, but this total gradually declined in 2010 and 2011. For boars, the
greatest CO2 emission occurred in 2012 and was 9.44 Gg CO2-eq/yr. Indirect N2O
emission was the largest component of GHG emissions in broilers. In layer
chickens, the largest contributing factor to GHG emissions was CO2 from direct
on-farm energy uses. For pig production, the largest component of GHG emissions
was CH4 from manure management, followed by CO2 emission from direct on-farm
energy use and CH4 enteric fermentation emission, which accounted for 8.47, 2.85,
and 2.82 Gg-CO2/yr, respectively. The greatest GHG emission intensity occurred in
female breeding sows relative to boars. Overall, it is an important issue for the
poultry and pig industry of South Korea to reduce GHG emissions with the
effective approaches for the sustainability of agricultural practices.

Strain 63MJ-2(T) was isolated from the feces of broad-winged katydid
(Pseudorhynchus japonicus) collected in Korea. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of this
strain showed the highest sequence similarity with that of Siphonobacter
aquaeclarae P2(T) (96.1%) and had low similarities (below 86.3%) with those of
other members of family 'Flexibacteraceae'. The strain 63MJ-2(T) is a strictly
aerobic, Gram-stain-negative, non-motile, rod-shaped bacterium. The strain grew
at 4-35°C (optimum, 25-30°C), pH of 5.0-9.0 (optimum, 6.0-7.0), and 0-2.0%
(optimum, 1.0-2.0) (w/v) NaCl. The DNA G+C content of strain 63MJ-2(T) was 43.5
mol%. The major fatty acids were C16:1 ω5c (42.5%), iso-C17:0 3-OH (18.7%), and
summed feature 3 (iso-C15:0 2-OH and/or C16:1 ω7c, 18.0%). The major menaquinone 
was MK-7 and polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, six unknown aminolipids,
and five unknown lipids. Based on the evidence from our polyphasic taxonomic
study, we conclude that strain 63MJ-2(T) should be classified as a novel species 
of the genus Siphonobacter, and propose the name Siphonobacter intestinalis sp.
nov. The type strain is 63MJ-2(T) (=KACC 18663(T) =NBRC 111883(T)).

The increasing temperature in Arctic tundra deepens the active layer, which is
the upper layer of permafrost soil that experiences repeated thawing and
freezing. The increasing of soil temperature and the deepening of active layer
seem to affect soil microbial communities. Therefore, information on soil
microbial communities at various soil depths is essential to understand their
potential responses to climate change in the active layer soil. We investigated
the community structure of soil bacteria in the active layer from moist acidic
tundra in Council, Alaska. We also interpreted their relationship with some
relevant soil physicochemical characteristics along soil depth with a fine scale 
(5 cm depth interval). The bacterial community structure was found to change
along soil depth. The relative abundances of Acidobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, 
Planctomycetes, and candidate phylum WPS-2 rapidly decreased with soil depth,
while those of Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, and candidate AD3
rapidly increased. A structural shift was also found in the soil bacterial
communities around 20 cm depth, where two organic (upper Oi and lower Oa)
horizons are subdivided. The quality and the decomposition degree of organic
matter might have influenced the bacterial community structure. Besides the
organic matter quality, the vertical distribution of bacterial communities was
also found to be related to soil pH and total phosphorus content. This study
showed the vertical change of bacterial community in the active layer with a fine
scale resolution and the possible influence of the quality of soil organic matter
on shaping bacterial community structure.

The magnitude of aerosol radiative forcing caused by anthropogenic emissions
depends on the baseline state of the atmosphere under pristine preindustrial
conditions. Measurements show that particle formation in atmospheric conditions
can occur solely from biogenic vapors. Here, we evaluate the potential effect of 
this source of particles on preindustrial cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)
concentrations and aerosol-cloud radiative forcing over the industrial period.
Model simulations show that the pure biogenic particle formation mechanism has a 
much larger relative effect on CCN concentrations in the preindustrial atmosphere
than in the present atmosphere because of the lower aerosol concentrations.
Consequently, preindustrial cloud albedo is increased more than under present day
conditions, and therefore the cooling forcing of anthropogenic aerosols is
reduced. The mechanism increases CCN concentrations by 20-100% over a large
fraction of the preindustrial lower atmosphere, and the magnitude of annual
global mean radiative forcing caused by changes of cloud albedo since 1750 is
reduced by [Formula: see text] (27%) to [Formula: see text] Model uncertainties, 
relatively slow formation rates, and limited available ambient measurements make 
it difficult to establish the significance of a mechanism that has its dominant
effect under preindustrial conditions. Our simulations predict more particle
formation in the Amazon than is observed. However, the first observation of pure 
organic nucleation has now been reported for the free troposphere. Given the
potentially significant effect on anthropogenic forcing, effort should be made to

To address climate change and environmental problems, it is becoming increasingly
important to establish biorefineries for the production of chemicals from
renewable non-food biomass. Here we report the development of Escherichia coli
strains capable of overproducing a four-carbon platform chemical 4-hybroxybutyric
acid (4-HB). Because 4-HB production is significantly affected by aeration level,
genome-scale metabolic model-based engineering strategies were designed under
aerobic and microaerobic conditions with emphasis on oxidative/reductive TCA
branches and glyoxylate shunt. Several different metabolic engineering strategies
were employed to develop strains suitable for fermentation both under aerobic and
microaerobic conditions. It was found that microaerobic condition was more
efficient than aerobic condition in achieving higher titer and productivity of
4-HB. The final engineered strain produced 103.4g/L of 4-HB by microaerobic
fed-batch fermentation using glycerol. The aeration-dependent optimization
strategy of TCA cycle will be useful for developing microbial strains producing
other reduced derivative chemicals of TCA cycle intermediates.

In order to assess the effects of increasing temperature on the reproductive
performance of fish, different thermal conditions (i.e., 25.0, 26.5, 27.5, 28.5, 
30.0 °C) were used in this study and the self-fertilizing hermaphrodite fish,
Kryptolebias marmoratus, was exposed to these different thermal conditions.
During an exposure period of 30 to 150 days, the gonadosomatic index (GSI),
gonadal development, the levels of plasma 17β-estradial (E2) and testosterone
(T), hepatic vitellogenin (VTG) mRNA abundance, and the number of self-fertilized
eggs were analyzed. This study confirmed that a high water temperature above
27.5 °C led to the suppression of self-fertility of hermaphroditic fish from
30 days after exposure. The oocyte quality and maturation would be affected by
the disruption of hepatic VTG synthesis at a high water temperature of 30 °C,
which resulted in the reduced the self-fertility in K. marmoratus. Consequently, 
this study suggests that elevated water temperature due to aquatic climate change
prior to sexual maturation and the onset of spawning can lead to the reproductive
dysfunction of hermaphroditic K. marmoratus.

The development of advanced materials for CO2 capture is of great importance for 
mitigating climate change. In this paper, we outline our discovery that
calcium-decorated carbon nanostructures, i.e., zigzag graphene nanoribbons
(ZGNRs), carbyne, and graphyne, have great potential for selective CO2 capture,
as demonstrated via first-principles calculations. Our findings show that
Ca-decorated ZGNRs can bind up to three CO2 molecules at each Ca atom site with
an adsorption energy of ∼-0.8 eV per CO2, making them suitable for reversible CO2
capture. They adsorb CO2 molecules preferentially, compared with other gas
molecules such as H2, N2, and CH4. Moreover, based on equilibrium thermodynamical
simulations, we confirm that Ca-decorated ZGNRs can capture CO2 selectively from 
a gas mixture with a capacity of ∼4.5 mmol g(-1) under ambient conditions.
Similar results have been found in other carbon nanomaterials, indicating the
generality of carbon based nanostructures for selective CO2 capture under ambient
conditions.

Urban areas are particularly vulnerable to heat-related health outcomes.
Simultaneous trends of climate change and urbanization may increase the urban
heat-related health burden. We investigated the effects of urban vegetation on
heat-related mortality, and evaluated whether different levels of vegetation and 
individuals' characteristics affect the temperature-mortality associations within
Seoul, Korea 2000-2009. We used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to 
assess the urban vegetation within Seoul. We applied an overdispersed Poisson
generalized linear model with interaction term between temperature and indicator 
of NDVI group (categorized in 3 levels) to assess the effect modification of the 
temperature-mortality association by urban vegetation. We conducted stratified
analysis to explore whether associations are affected by individual
characteristics of sex and age. The association between total mortality and a 1°C
increase in temperature above the 90th percentile (25.1°C) (the "heat effect")
was the highest for gus with low NDVI. The heat effect was a 4.1% (95% confidence
interval (CI) 2.3, 5.9%), 3.0% (95% CI 0.2, 5.9%), and 2.2% (95% CI -0.5, 5.0%)
increase in mortality risk for low, medium, and high NDVI group, respectively.
Estimated risks showed similar effects by sex and age. Our findings suggest a
higher mortality effect of high temperature in areas with lower vegetation in
Seoul, Korea.

Terrestrial Carbon Cycle Variability.

A growing literature is reporting on how the terrestrial carbon cycle is
experiencing year-to-year variability because of climate anomalies and trends
caused by global change. As CO 2 concentration records in the atmosphere exceed
50 years and as satellite records reach over 30 years in length, we are becoming 
better able to address carbon cycle variability and trends. Here we review how
variable the carbon cycle is, how large the trends in its gross and net fluxes
are, and how well the signal can be separated from noise. We explore mechanisms
that explain year-to-year variability and trends by deconstructing the global
carbon budget. The CO 2 concentration record is detecting a significant increase 
in the seasonal amplitude between 1958 and now. Inferential methods provide a
variety of explanations for this result, but a conclusive attribution remains
elusive. Scientists have reported that this trend is a consequence of the
greening of the biosphere, stronger northern latitude photosynthesis, more
photosynthesis by semi-arid ecosystems, agriculture and the green revolution,
tropical temperature anomalies, or increased winter respiration. At the global
scale, variability in the terrestrial carbon cycle can be due to changes in
constituent fluxes, gross primary productivity, plant respiration and
heterotrophic (microbial) respiration, and losses due to fire, land use change,
soil erosion, or harvesting. It remains controversial whether or not there is a
significant trend in global primary productivity (due to rising CO 2,
temperature, nitrogen deposition, changing land use, and preponderance of wet and
dry regions). The degree to which year-to-year variability in temperature and
precipitation anomalies affect global primary productivity also remains
uncertain. For perspective, interannual variability in global gross primary
productivity is relatively small (on the order of 2 Pg-C y (-1)) with respect to 
a large and uncertain background (123 +/- 4 Pg-C y (-1)), and detected trends in 
global primary productivity are even smaller (33 Tg-C y (-2)). Yet residual
carbon balance methods infer that the terrestrial biosphere is experiencing a
significant and growing carbon sink. Possible explanations for this large and
growing net land sink include roles of land use change and greening of the land, 
regional enhancement of photosynthesis, and down regulation of plant and soil
respiration with warming temperatures. Longer time series of variables needed to 
provide top-down and bottom-up assessments of the carbon cycle are needed to
resolve these pressing and unresolved issues regarding how, why, and at what
rates gross and net carbon fluxes are changing.

The biodiversity-productivity relationship (BPR) is foundational to our
understanding of the global extinction crisis and its impacts on ecosystem
functioning. Understanding BPR is critical for the accurate valuation and
effective conservation of biodiversity. Using ground-sourced data from 777,126
permanent plots, spanning 44 countries and most terrestrial biomes, we reveal a
globally consistent positive concave-down BPR, showing that continued
biodiversity loss would result in an accelerating decline in forest productivity 
worldwide. The value of biodiversity in maintaining commercial forest
productivity alone-US$166 billion to 490 billion per year according to our
estimation-is more than twice what it would cost to implement effective global
conservation. This highlights the need for a worldwide reassessment of
biodiversity values, forest management strategies, and conservation priorities.

Impacts of climate change on the hydrologic processes under future climate change
conditions were assessed over Muda and Dungun watersheds of Peninsular Malaysia
by means of a coupled regional climate and physically-based hydrology model
utilizing an ensemble of future climate change projections. An ensemble of 15
different future climate realizations from coarse resolution global climate
models' (GCMs) projections for the 21st century was dynamically downscaled to 6km
resolution over Peninsular Malaysia by a regional climate model, which was then
coupled with the watershed hydrology model WEHY through the atmospheric boundary 
layer over Muda and Dungun watersheds. Hydrologic simulations were carried out at
hourly increments and at hillslope-scale in order to assess the impacts of
climate change on the water balances and flooding conditions in the 21st century.
The coupled regional climate and hydrology model was simulated for a duration of 
90years for each of the 15 realizations. It is demonstrated that the increase in 
mean monthly flows due to the impact of expected climate change during 2040-2100 
is statistically significant from April to May and from July to October at Muda
watershed. Also, the increase in mean monthly flows is shown to be significant in
November during 2030-2070 and from November to December during 2070-2100 at
Dungun watershed. In other words, the impact of the expected climate change will 
be significant during the northeast and southwest monsoon seasons at Muda
watershed and during the northeast monsoon season at Dungun watershed.
Furthermore, the flood frequency analyses for both watersheds indicated an
overall increasing trend in the second half of the 21st century.

BACKGROUND: Filarioid nematode parasites are major health hazards with important 
medical, veterinary and economic implications. Recently, they have been
considered as indicators of climate change.
FINDINGS: In this paper, we report the first record of Setaria tundra in roe deer
from the Iberian Peninsula. Adult S. tundra were collected from the peritoneal
cavity during the post-mortem examination of a 2 year-old male roe deer, which
belonged to a private fenced estate in La Alcarria (Guadalajara, Spain). Since
2012, the area has suffered a high roe deer decline rate (75 %), for unknown
reasons. Aiming to support the morphological identification and to determine the 
phylogenetic position of S. tundra recovered from the roe deer, a fragment of the
mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene from the two
morphologically identified parasites was amplified, sequenced and compared with
corresponding sequences of other filarioid nematode species. Phylogenetic
analyses revealed that the isolate of S. tundra recovered was basal to all other 
formely reported Setaria tundra sequences. The presence of all other haplotypes
in Northern Europe may be indicative of a South to North outbreak in Europe.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of S. tundra in roe deer from the Iberian
Peninsula, with interesting phylogenetic results, which may have further
implications in the epidemiological and genetic studies of these filarioid
parasites. More studies are needed to explore the reasons and dynamics behind the
rapid host/geographic expansion of the filarioid parasites in Europe.

Paddy rice in monsoon Asia plays an important role in global food security and
climate change. Here we documented annual dynamics of paddy rice areas in the
northern frontier of Asia, including Northeastern (NE) China, North Korea, South 
Korea, and Japan, from 2000-2014 through analysis of satellite images. The paddy 
rice area has increased by 120% (2.5 to 5.5 million ha) in NE China, in
comparison to a decrease in South Korea and Japan, and the paddy rice centroid
shifted northward from 41.16 °N to 43.70 °N (~310 km) in this period. Market,
technology, policy, and climate together drove the rice expansion in NE China.
The increased use of greenhouse nurseries, improved rice cultivars, agricultural 
subsidy policy, and a rising rice price generally promoted northward paddy rice
expansion. The potential effects of large rice expansion on climate change and
ecological services should be paid more attention in the future.

In this study, in order to understand accurate calculation of greenhouse gas
emissions of urban solid waste incineration facilities, which are major waste
incineration facilities, and problems likely to occur at this time, emissions
were calculated by classifying calculation methods into 3 types. For the
comparison of calculation methods, the waste characteristics ratio, dry substance
content by waste characteristics, carbon content in dry substance, and (12)C
content were analyzed; and in particular, CO2 concentration in incineration gases
and (12)C content were analyzed together. In this study, 3 types of calculation
methods were made through the assay value, and by using each calculation method, 
emissions of urban solid waste incineration facilities were calculated then
compared. As a result of comparison, with Calculation Method A, which used the
default value as presented in the IPCC guidelines, greenhouse gas emissions were 
calculated for the urban solid waste incineration facilities A and B at 244.43
ton CO2/day and 322.09 ton CO2/day, respectively. Hence, it showed a lot of
difference from Calculation Methods B and C, which used the assay value of this
study. It is determined that this was because the default value as presented in
IPCC, as the world average value, could not reflect the characteristics of urban 
solid waste incineration facilities. Calculation Method B indicated 163.31 ton
CO2/day and 230.34 ton CO2/day respectively for the urban solid waste
incineration facilities A and B; also, Calculation Method C indicated 151.79 ton 
CO2/day and 218.99 ton CO2/day, respectively.IMPLICATIONS: This study intends to 
compare greenhouse gas emissions calculated using (12)C content default value
provided by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) with greenhouse 
gas emissions calculated using (12)C content and waste assay value that can
reflect the characteristics of the target urban solid waste incineration
facilities. Also, the concentration and (12)C content were calculated by directly
collecting incineration gases of the target urban solid waste incineration
facilities, and greenhouse gas emissions of the target urban solid waste
incineration facilities through this survey were compared with greenhouse gas
emissions, which used the previously calculated assay value of solid waste.

As climate change has become one of the major global risks, our heavy dependence 
on petroleum-derived fuels has received much public attention. To solve such
problems, production of sustainable fuels has been intensively studied over the
past years. Thanks to recent advances in synthetic biology and metabolic
engineering technologies, bio-based platforms for advanced biofuels production
have been developed using various microorganisms. The strategies for production
of advanced biofuels have converged upon four major metabolic routes: the
2-ketoacid pathway, the fatty acid synthesis (FAS) pathway, the isoprenoid
pathway, and the reverse β-oxidation pathway. Additionally, the polyketide
synthesis pathway has recently been attracting interest as a promising
alternative biofuel production route. In this article, recent trends in advanced 
biofuels production are reviewed by categorizing them into three types of
advanced biofuels: alcohols, biodiesel and jet fuel, and gasoline. Focus is given
on the strategies of employing synthetic biology and metabolic engineering for
the development of microbial strains producing advanced fuels. Finally, the
prospects for future advances needed to achieve much more efficient bio-based
production of advanced biofuels are discussed, focusing on designing advanced
biofuel production pathways coupled with screening, modifying, and creating novel
enzymes.

Temperature plays an important role in the growth and development of arthropods, 
and thus the current trend of climate change will alter their biology and species
distribution. We used Chaetodactylus krombeini (Acari: Chaetodactylidae), a
cleptoparasitic mite associated with Osmia bees (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), as a
model organism to investigate how temperature affects the development and
voltinism of C. krombeini in the eastern United States. The effects of
temperature on the stage-specific development of C. krombeini were determined at 
seven constant temperatures (16.1, 20.2, 24.1, 27.5, 30.0, 32.4 and 37.8°C).
Parameters for stage-specific development, such as threshold temperatures and
thermal constant, were determined by using empirical models. Results of this
study showed that C. krombeini eggs developed successfully to adult at all
temperatures tested except 37.8°C. The nonlinear and linear empirical models were
applied to describe quantitatively the relationship between temperature and
development of each C. krombeini stage. The nonlinear Lactin model estimated
optimal temperatures as 31.4, 32.9, 32.6 and 32.5°C for egg, larva, nymph, and
egg to adult, respectively. In the linear model, the lower threshold temperatures
were estimated to be 9.9, 14.7, 13.0 and 12.4°C for egg, larva, nymph, and egg to
adult, respectively. The thermal constant for each stage completion were 61.5,
28.1, 64.8 and 171.1 degree days for egg, larva, nymph, and egg to adult,
respectively. Under the future climate scenarios, the number of generations
(i.e., voltinism) would increase more likely by 1.5 to 2.0 times by the year of
2100 according to simulation. The findings herein firstly provided comprehensive 
data on thermal development of C. krombeini and implications for the management
of C. krombeini populations under global warming were discussed. *Scientific

BACKGROUND: Malaria is a significant public health issue in Papua New Guinea
(PNG) as the burden is among the highest in Asia and the Pacific region. Though
PNG's vulnerability to climate change and sensitivity of malaria mosquitoes to
weather are well-documented, there are few in-depth epidemiological studies
conducted on the potential impacts of climate on malaria incidence in the
country.
METHODS: This study explored what and how local weather and global climate
variability impact on malaria incidence in five regions of PNG. Time series
methods were applied to evaluate the associations of malaria incidence with
weather and climate factors, respectively. Local weather factors including
precipitation and temperature and global climate phenomena such as El
Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the ENSO Modoki, the Southern Annular Mode, and
the Indian Ocean Dipole were considered in analyses.
RESULTS: The results showed that malaria incidence was associated with local
weather factors in most regions but at the different lag times and in directions.
Meanwhile, there were trends in associations with global climate factors by
geographical locations of study sites.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall heterogeneous associations suggest the importance of
location-specific approaches in PNG not only for further investigations but also 
public health interventions in repose to the potential impacts arising from
climate change.

The methodology provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
guidelines is widely used for estimating enteric methane (CH4) production by
cattle. No attempt other than the default values in the IPCC Tier 1 has been made
for estimating CH4 emission from Hanwoo, a dominant beef species in Korea raised 
in a unique feeding system. The objective of this study was to compare models for
estimating the CH4 emission factor (MEF; kg CH4/head/year) for enteric
fermentation in Hanwoo steers. The MEF was estimated based on Korea- and
Hanwoo-specific data obtained from the literature using several models. The
models include the IPCC Tier 1 (T1), the IPCC Tier 2 method (T2), the IPCC Tier 2
methodology with actual dry matter intake (T2DMI), and the Japanese Tier 3 method
(JT3). The JT3 was included due to the similarity in the beef cattle production
system between the two countries. Estimated MEF using T2 were 43.4, 33.9, and
36.2 kg CH4/head/year for the growing, finishing, and overall period,
respectively. The overall MEF estimated using T2 was 23 % lower than the estimate
by T1 (47.0 kg CH4/head/year). There were significant differences in the
estimated MEF for enteric fermentation of Hanwoo steers among the methods
(P < 0.05). The overall MEF estimated by JT3 was 69.1 kg CH4/head/year, which was
significantly higher than the estimates by T2 (36.2 kg) and T2DMI (33.5 kg). The 
JT3 estimated the highest values in all periods possibly due to overestimation of
the conversion ratio of feed energy to CH4. No significant difference was found
in the overall MEF of Hanwoo steers between T2 and T2DMI. However, T2DMI
estimated 8 % higher and 14 % lower MEF than T2 for the growing and finishing
period, respectively, mainly because the T2 significantly over-predicts the gross
energy intake of Hanwoo steers at the high level of intake. The IPCC default
methods have limitations in their use for a feeding systems in non-western
countries, and thus development of a country-specific methodology and parameter
estimates for enteric CH4 production is required for Hanwoo and other cattle
production systems.

Land-use change and intensification threaten bee populations worldwide,
imperilling pollination services. Global models are needed to better
characterise, project, and mitigate bees' responses to these human impacts. The
available data are, however, geographically and taxonomically unrepresentative;
most data are from North America and Western Europe, overrepresenting bumblebees 
and raising concerns that model results may not be generalizable to other regions
and taxa. To assess whether the geographic and taxonomic biases of data could
undermine effectiveness of models for conservation policy, we have collated from 
the published literature a global dataset of bee diversity at sites facing
land-use change and intensification, and assess whether bee responses to these
pressures vary across 11 regions (Western, Northern, Eastern and Southern Europe;
North, Central and South America; Australia and New Zealand; South East Asia;
Middle and Southern Africa) and between bumblebees and other bees. Our analyses
highlight strong regionally-based responses of total abundance, species richness 
and Simpson's diversity to land use, caused by variation in the sensitivity of
species and potentially in the nature of threats. These results suggest that
global extrapolation of models based on geographically and taxonomically
restricted data may underestimate the true uncertainty, increasing the risk of
ecological surprises.

Approximately 34 million years ago across the Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT), 
Earth's climate tipped from a largely unglaciated state into one that sustained
large ice sheets on Antarctica. Antarctic glaciation is attributed to a threshold
response to slow decline in atmospheric CO2 but our understanding of the feedback
processes triggered and of climate change on the other contents is limited. Here 
we present new geochemical records of terrigenous dust accumulating on the sea
floor across the EOT from a site in the central equatorial Pacific. We report a
change in dust chemistry from an Asian affinity to a Central-South American
provenance that occurs geologically synchronously with the initiation of stepwise
global cooling, glaciation of Antarctica and aridification on the northern
continents. We infer that the inter-tropical convergence zone of intense
precipitation extended to our site during late Eocene, at least four degrees
latitude further south than today, but that it migrated northwards in step with
global cooling and initiation of Antarctic glaciation. Our findings point to an
atmospheric teleconnection between extratropical cooling and rainfall climate in 
the tropics and the mid-latitude belt of the westerlies operating across the most
pivotal transition in climate state of the Cenozoic Era.

Global warming is likely leading to species' distributional shifts, resulting in 
changes in local community compositions and diversity patterns. In this study, we
applied species distribution models to evaluate the potential impacts of
temperature increase on ant communities in Korean temperate forests, by testing
hypotheses that 1) the risk of extinction of forest ant species would increase
over time, and 2) the changes in species distribution ranges could drive upward
movements of ant communities and further alter patterns of species richness. We
sampled ant communities at 335 evenly distributed sites across South Korea and
modelled the future distribution range for each species using generalized
additive models. To account for spatial autocorrelation, autocovariate
regressions were conducted prior to generalized additive models. Among 29 common 
ant species, 12 species were estimated to shrink their suitable geographic areas,
whereas five species would benefit from future global warming. Species richness
was highest at low altitudes in the current period, and it was projected to be
highest at the mid-altitudes in the 2080s, resulting in an upward movement of 4.9
m yr-1. This altered the altitudinal pattern of species richness from a
monotonic-decrease curve (common in temperate regions) to a bell-shaped curve
(common in tropical regions). Overall, ant communities in temperate forests are
vulnerable to the on-going global warming and their altitudinal movements are
similar to other faunal communities.

OBJECTIVES: Several studies identified a heterogeneous impact of heat on
mortality in hot and cool regions during a fixed period, whereas less evidence is
available for changes in risk over time due to climate change in these regions.
We compared changes in risk during periods without (1996-2000) and with
(2008-2012) heatwave warning forecasts in regions of South Korea with different
climates.
METHODS: Study areas were categorised into 3 clusters based on the spatial
clustering of cooling degree days in the period 1993-2012: hottest cluster
(cluster H), moderate cluster (cluster M) and cool cluster (cluster C). The risk 
was estimated according to increases in the daily all-cause, cardiovascular and
respiratory mortality per 1°C change in daily temperature above the threshold,
using a generalised additive model.
RESULTS: The risk of all types of mortality increased in cluster H in 2008-2012, 
compared with 1996-2000, whereas the risks in all-combined regions and cooler
clusters decreased. Temporal increases in mortality risk were larger for some
vulnerable subgroups, including younger adults (<75 years), those with a lower
education and blue-collar workers, in cluster H as well as all-combined regions. 
Different patterns of risk change among clusters might be attributable to large
increases in heatwave frequency or duration during study periods and the degree
of urbanisation in cluster H.
CONCLUSIONS: People living in hotter regions or with a lower socioeconomic status
are at higher risk following an increasing trend of heat-related mortality risks.
Continuous efforts are needed to understand factors which affect changes in
heat-related mortality risks.

Effective clinical nutrition practice depends on a sound knowledge of biomedical,
societal and environmental science and the skills to diagnose, prevent and manage
the health problems related to food patterns, energy equilibrium (mostly to do
with physical activity) and nutrient metabolism. Its delivery needs to be
accessible, equitable, affordable and sustainable. Ordinarily, this will require 
both local and widely distributed health services. In North-East (NE) Asia, these
requisites are being met to an ever increasing extent. The roots of this progress
are steeped in cultures which acknowledge the food-health connections and support
education which pays regard to these connections. As elsewhere, however, the food
and health systems, their safety and security are threatened by exploitative
operatives. In China, a concerted effort was made in the mid-1980s to foster
clinical nutrition in major hospitals throughout the country by programs directed
at medical graduates, nursing and kitchen staff; dietetics has appeared much more
recently. By contrast, Japan has had an extensive and well-trained dietetic
workforce for much longer, alongside a vibrant basic nutrition science
constituency in its universities and foodnutraceutical industry. South Korea and 
Taiwan have traversed a similar course to that in Japan. Now, all of these NE
Asian economies have gathered rapid momentum in the publication of innovative
approaches to public health and clinical nutrition which have the prospect of not
only improving health outcomes, but also reducing the societal and financial
burden of health care. This is particularly important in rapidly ageing
societies, which they are. It is also a growing challenge where climate change
threatens to engulf the lives and destinies of hundreds of millions of Asians on 
account of natural disasters, water and food insecurity.

The Indo-Pacific warm pool (IPWP) has warmed and grown substantially during the
past century. The IPWP is Earth's largest region of warm sea surface temperatures
(SSTs), has the highest rainfall, and is fundamental to global atmospheric
circulation and hydrological cycle. The region has also experienced the world's
highest rates of sea-level rise in recent decades, indicating large increases in 
ocean heat content and leading to substantial impacts on small island states in
the region. Previous studies have considered mechanisms for the basin-scale ocean
warming, but not the causes of the observed IPWP expansion, where expansion in
the Indian Ocean has far exceeded that in the Pacific Ocean. We identify human
and natural contributions to the observed IPWP changes since the 1950s by
comparing observations with climate model simulations using an optimal
fingerprinting technique. Greenhouse gas forcing is found to be the dominant
cause of the observed increases in IPWP intensity and size, whereas natural
fluctuations associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation have played a
smaller yet significant role. Further, we show that the shape and impact of
human-induced IPWP growth could be asymmetric between the Indian and Pacific
basins, the causes of which remain uncertain. Human-induced changes in the IPWP
have important implications for understanding and projecting related changes in
monsoonal rainfall, and frequency or intensity of tropical storms, which have
profound socioeconomic consequences.

Pollen is an important cause of respiratory allergic reactions. As individual
sanitation has improved, allergy risk has increased, and this trend is expected
to continue due to climate change. Atmospheric pollen concentration is highly
influenced by weather conditions. Regression analysis and modeling of the
relationships between airborne pollen concentrations and weather conditions were 
performed to analyze and forecast pollen conditions. Traditionally, daily pollen 
concentration has been estimated using regression models that describe the
relationships between observed pollen concentrations and weather conditions.
These models were able to forecast daily concentrations at the sites of
observation, but lacked broader spatial applicability beyond those sites. To
overcome this limitation, an integrated modeling scheme was developed that is
designed to represent the underlying processes of pollen production and
distribution. A maximum potential for airborne pollen is first determined using
the Weibull probability density function. Then, daily pollen concentration is
estimated using multiple regression models. Daily risk grade levels are
determined based on the risk criteria used in Korea. The mean percentages of
agreement between the observed and estimated levels were 81.4-88.2 % and
92.5-98.5 % for oak and Japanese hop pollens, respectively. The new models
estimated daily pollen risk more accurately than the original statistical models 
because of the newly integrated biological response curves. Although they
overestimated seasonal mean concentration, they did not simulate all of the peak 
concentrations. This issue would be resolved by adding more variables that affect
the prevalence and internal maturity of pollens.

A dynamic multimedia model (POPsLTEA) for an East Asia region was developed and
evaluated to quantitatively assess how climate change (CC) alters the
environmental fate and transport dynamics of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
(PAHs) in air, water, soil, and sediment. To cover the entire model domain
(25°N-50°N and 98°E-148°E) where China, Japan, and South and North Koreas are of 
primary concern, a total of 5000 main cells of 50km×50km size were used while
1008 cells of a finer spatial resolution (12.5km×12.5km) was nested for South
Korea (33°N-38°N and 126°E-132°E). Most of the predicted concentrations agreed
with the observed values within one order of magnitude with a tendency of
overestimation for air and sediment. Prediction of the atmospheric concentration 
was statistically significant in both coincidence and association, suggesting the
model's potential to successfully predict the fate and transport of the PAHs as
influenced by CC. An example study of benzo(a)pyrene demonstrates that direction 
and strength of the CC influence on the pollution levels vary with the location
and environmental media. As compared to the five year period of 2011 to 2015, the
changes across the model domain in the annual geometric mean concentration over
the years of 2021 through 2100 were predicted to range from 88% to 304%, from 84%
to 109%, from 32% to 362%, and from 49% to 303%, in air, soil, surface water, and
sea water, respectively, under the scenario of RCP8.5.

Global climate change leading to increased temperatures may affect shifts in
physiological processes especially in ectothermic organisms.
Temperature-dependent shifts in developmental rate in particular, may lead to
life-long changes in adult morphology and physiology. Combined with anthropogenic
changes in the chemical environment, changes in developmental outcomes may affect
adult functionality. The purpose of this study is to determine 1) if small
increases in diel water temperature affect the development of Arizona tiger
salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum nebulosum) larvae, and 2) if this change interacts
with exposure to the common environmental thyroid disrupting compound,
perchlorate. Larvae between Watson and Russell developmental stages 8-13 were
exposed to ammonium perchlorate (AP) at doses of 0, 20 or 200ppb and then raised 
at either ambient or a 0.9°C elevated above ambient temperature for 81days in
outdoor enclosures. During the first 5 treatment weeks, AP treatment induced
slower development and smaller snout-vent length (SVL) of exposed larvae, but
only in the elevated temperature group. During the later stages of development,
the small increase in temperature, regardless of AP treatment, tended to decrease
the time to metamorphosis and resulted in a significantly smaller body mass and
worse body condition. Our results suggest that even small diel water temperature 
increases can affect the developmental process of salamanders and this shift in
the water temperature may interact with a common environmental contaminant.

Understanding the effects of global climate change from both environmental and
human health perspectives has gained great importance. Particularly, studies on
the direct effect of temperature increase on future mortality have been
conducted. However, few of those studies considered population changes, and
although the world population is rapidly aging, no previous study considered the 
effect of society aging. Here we present a projection of future
temperature-related mortality due to both climate and demographic changes in
seven major cities of South Korea, a fast aging country, until 2100; we used the 
HadGEM3-RA model under four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios 
(RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) and the United Nations world population prospects
under three fertility scenarios (high, medium, and low). The results showed
markedly increased mortality in the elderly group, significantly increasing the
overall future mortality. In 2090s, South Korea could experience a four- to
six-time increase in temperature-related mortality compared to that during
1992-2010 under four different RCP scenarios and three different fertility
variants, while the mortality is estimated to increase only by 0.5 to 1.5 times
assuming no population aging. Therefore, not considering population aging may
significantly underestimate temperature risks.

Clostridium tyrobutyricum is a Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium that efficiently
produces butyric acid and is considered a promising host for anaerobic production
of bulk chemicals. Due to limited knowledge on the genetic and metabolic
characteristics of this strain, however, little progress has been made in
metabolic engineering of this strain. Here we report the complete genome sequence
of C. tyrobutyricum KCTC 5387 (ATCC 25755), which consists of a 3.07-Mbp
chromosome and a 63-kbp plasmid. The results of genomic analyses suggested that
C. tyrobutyricum produces butyrate from butyryl-coenzyme A (butyryl-CoA) through 
acetate reassimilation by CoA transferase, differently from Clostridium
acetobutylicum, which uses the phosphotransbutyrylase-butyrate kinase pathway;
this was validated by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) of related genes,
protein expression levels, in vitro CoA transferase assay, and fed-batch
fermentation. In addition, the changes in protein expression levels during the
course of batch fermentations on glucose were examined by shotgun proteomics.
Unlike C. acetobutylicum, the expression levels of proteins involved in
glycolytic and fermentative pathways in C. tyrobutyricum did not decrease even at
the stationary phase. Proteins related to energy conservation mechanisms,
including Rnf complex, NfnAB, and pyruvate-phosphate dikinase that are absent in 
C. acetobutylicum, were identified. Such features explain why this organism can
produce butyric acid to a much higher titer and better tolerate toxic
metabolites. This study presenting the complete genome sequence, global protein
expression profiles, and genome-based metabolic characteristics during the batch 
fermentation of C. tyrobutyricum will be valuable in designing strategies for
metabolic engineering of this strain.IMPORTANCE: Bio-based production of
chemicals from renewable biomass has become increasingly important due to our
concerns on climate change and other environmental problems. C. tyrobutyricum has
been used for efficient butyric acid production. In order to further increase the
performance and expand the capabilities of this strain toward production of other
chemicals, metabolic engineering needs to be performed. For this, better
understanding on the metabolic and physiological characteristics of this
bacterium at the genome level is needed. This work reporting the results of
complete genomic and proteomic analyses together with new insights on butyric
acid biosynthetic pathway and energy conservation will allow development of
strategies for metabolic engineering of C. tyrobutyricum for the bio-based
production of various chemicals in addition to butyric acid.

We observed the changes in aggressiveness and fecundity of the anthracnose
pathogen Colletotrichum acutatum on hot pepper, under the ambient and the
twice-ambient treatments. Artificial infection was repeated over 100 cycles for
ambient (25°C/400 ppm CO2) and twice-ambient (30°C/700 ppm CO2) growth chamber
conditions, over 3 years. During repeated infection cycles (ICs) on green-pepper 
fruits, the aggressiveness (incidence [% of diseased fruits among 20 inoculated
fruits] and severity [lesion length in mm] of infection) and fecundity (the
average number of spores per five lesions) of the pathogen were measured in each 
cycle and compared between the ambient and twice-ambient treatments, and also
between the early (ICs 31-50) and late (ICs 81-100) generations. In summary, the 
pathogen's aggressiveness and fecundity were significantly lower in the late
generation. It is likely that aggressiveness and fecundity of C. acutatum may be 
reduced as global CO2 and temperatures increase.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the individual change of
International prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Overactive Bladder Symptom Score 
(OABSS) in each patient by temperature conditions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) was
explored using the IPSS and OABSS questionnaires that were completed by 2.486
subjects (923 males and 1.563 females) aged 60 years and older. Korea
Meteorological Administration data was used to determine daily average
temperature and daily temperature difference on the interview dates at each site.
RESULTS: The mean IPSS and mean age for males was 13.45±8.24 and 75.03±6.20
years, respectively. The mean OABSS and mean age for females was 4.41±3.10 and
73.74±6.03years, respectively. Daily average temperature and daily temperature
difference ranged from-3.4-28.3oC and 2.2-16.9oC, respectively. Age was a
significantly risk factor for IPSS, OABSS, and QoL (P<0.001, <0.001, and 0.005,
respectively). After multiple regression analysis, daily average temperatures did
not show a statistically significant change in IPSS and OABSS. Only daily
temperature differences were associated with male LUTS.
CONCLUSIONS: While LUTS could be worsened in low temperatures generally, IPSS and
OABSS were not affected by daily average temperature conditions. Daily
temperature differences may be more influential than daily average temperatures.

BACKGROUND: The evidence and method are limited for the associations between
mortality and temperature variability (TV) within or between days.
OBJECTIVES: We developed a novel method to calculate TV and investigated
TV-mortality associations using a large multicountry data set.
METHODS: We collected daily data for temperature and mortality from 372 locations
in 12 countries/regions (Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, Moldova, South 
Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States). We
calculated TV from the standard deviation of the minimum and maximum temperatures
during the exposure days. Two-stage analyses were used to assess the relationship
between TV and mortality. In the first stage, a Poisson regression model allowing
over-dispersion was used to estimate the community-specific TV-mortality
relationship, after controlling for potential confounders. In the second stage, a
meta-analysis was used to pool the effect estimates within each country.
RESULTS: There was a significant association between TV and mortality in all
countries, even after controlling for the effects of daily mean temperature. In
stratified analyses, TV was still significantly associated with mortality in
cold, hot, and moderate seasons. Mortality risks related to TV were higher in hot
areas than in cold areas when using short TV exposures (0-1 days), whereas
TV-related mortality risks were higher in moderate areas than in cold and hot
areas when using longer TV exposures (0-7 days).
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that more attention should be paid to unstable 
weather conditions in order to protect health. These findings may have
implications for developing public health policies to manage health risks of
climate change.

Accurate predictions of crop yield are critical for developing effective
agricultural and food policies at the regional and global scales. We evaluated a 
machine-learning method, Random Forests (RF), for its ability to predict crop
yield responses to climate and biophysical variables at global and regional
scales in wheat, maize, and potato in comparison with multiple linear regressions
(MLR) serving as a benchmark. We used crop yield data from various sources and
regions for model training and testing: 1) gridded global wheat grain yield, 2)
maize grain yield from US counties over thirty years, and 3) potato tuber and
maize silage yield from the northeastern seaboard region. RF was found highly
capable of predicting crop yields and outperformed MLR benchmarks in all
performance statistics that were compared. For example, the root mean square
errors (RMSE) ranged between 6 and 14% of the average observed yield with RF
models in all test cases whereas these values ranged from 14% to 49% for MLR
models. Our results show that RF is an effective and versatile machine-learning
method for crop yield predictions at regional and global scales for its high
accuracy and precision, ease of use, and utility in data analysis. RF may result 
in a loss of accuracy when predicting the extreme ends or responses beyond the
boundaries of the training data.

Source quantification of carbonaceous aerosols in the Chinese outflow regions
still remains uncertain despite their high mass concentrations. Here, we
unambiguously quantified fossil and nonfossil contributions to elemental carbon
(EC) and organic carbon (OC) of total suspended particles (TSP) from a regional
receptor site in the outflow of Northeast China using radiocarbon measurement. OC
and EC concentrations were lower in summer, representing mainly marine air, than 
in other seasons, when air masses mostly traveled over continental regions in
Mongolia and northeast China. The annual-mean contribution from fossil-fuel
combustion to EC was 76 ± 11% (0.1-1.3 μg m(-3)). The remaining 24 ± 11%
(0.03-0.42 μg m(-3)) was attributed to biomass burning, with slightly higher
contribution in the cold period (∼31%) compared to the warm period (∼21%) because
of enhanced emissions from regional biomass combustion sources in China. OC was
generally dominated by nonfossil sources, with an annual average of 66 ± 11%
(0.5-2.8 μg m(-3)), approximately half of which was apportioned to primary
biomass-burning sources (34 ± 6%). In winter, OC almost equally originated from
primary OC (POC) emissions and secondary OC (SOC) formation from fossil fuel and 
biomass-burning sources. In contrast, summertime OC was dominated by primary
biogenic emissions as well as secondary production from biogenic and
biomass-burning sources, but fossil-derived SOC was the smallest contributor.
Distinction of POC and SOC was performed using primary POC-to-EC emission ratios 
separated for fossil and nonfossil emissions.

In Korea, the amount of greenhouse gases released due to waste materials was
14,800,000 t CO2eq in 2012, which increased from 5,000,000 t CO2eq in 2010. This 
included the amount released due to incineration, which has gradually increased
since 2010. Incineration was found to be the biggest contributor to greenhouse
gases, with 7,400,000 t CO2eq released in 2012. Therefore, with regards to the
trading of greenhouse gases emissions initiated in 2015 and the writing of the
national inventory report, it is important to increase the reliability of the
measurements related to the incineration of waste materials. This research
explored methods for estimating the biomass fraction at Korean MSW incinerator
facilities and compared the biomass fractions obtained with the different biomass
fraction estimation methods. The biomass fraction was estimated by the method
using default values of fossil carbon fraction suggested by IPCC, the method
using the solid waste composition, and the method using incinerator flue gas. The
highest biomass fractions in Korean municipal solid waste incinerator facilities 
were estimated by the IPCC Default method, followed by the MSW analysis method
and the Flue gas analysis method. Therefore, the difference in the biomass
fraction estimate was the greatest between the IPCC Default and the Flue gas
analysis methods. The difference between the MSW analysis and the flue gas
analysis methods was smaller than the difference with IPCC Default method. This
suggested that the use of the IPCC default method cannot reflect the
characteristics of Korean waste incinerator facilities and Korean
MSW.IMPLICATIONS: Incineration is one of most effective methods for disposal of
municipal solid waste (MSW). This paper investigates the applicability of using
biomass content to estimate the amount of CO2 released, and compares the biomass 
contents determined by different methods in order to establish a method for
estimating biomass in the MSW incinerator facilities of Korea. After analyzing
the biomass contents of the collected solid waste samples and the flue gas
samples, the results were compared with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) method, and it seems that to calculate the biomass fraction it is
better to use the flue gas analysis method than the IPCC method. It is valuable
to design and operate a real new incineration power plant, especially for the
estimation of greenhouse gas emissions.

Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a perennial C4 grass native to North America
and successfully adapted to diverse environmental conditions. It offers the
potential to reduce soil surface carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and mitigate climate
change. However, information on how these CO2 fluxes respond to changing climate 
is still lacking. In this study, CO2 fluxes were monitored continuously from 2011
through 2014 using high frequency measurements from Switchgrass land seeded in
2008 on an experimental site that has been previously used for soybean (Glycine
max L.) in South Dakota, USA. DAYCENT, a process-based model, was used to
simulate CO2 fluxes. An improved methodology CPTE [Combining Parameter estimation
(PEST) with "Trial and Error" method] was used to calibrate DAYCENT. The
calibrated DAYCENT model was used for simulating future CO2 emissions based on
different climate change scenarios. This study showed that: (i) the measured soil
CO2 fluxes from Switchgrass land were higher for 2012 which was a drought year,
and these fluxes when simulated using DAYCENT for long-term (2015-2070) provided 
a pattern of polynomial curve; (ii) the simulated CO2 fluxes provided different
patterns with temperature and precipitation changes in a long-term, (iii) the
future CO2 fluxes from Switchgrass land under different changing climate
scenarios were not significantly different, therefore, it can be concluded that
Switchgrass grown for longer durations could reduce changes in CO2 fluxes from
soil as a result of temperature and precipitation changes to some extent.

In this study, the status of Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection was assessed in 
shelter dogs in Seoul, Korea, with PCR and phylogenetic analyses. Nested PCR on
1058 collected blood samples revealed only one A. phagocytophilum positive sample
(female, age <1year, mixed breed, collected from the north of the Han River). The
genetic variability of A. phagocytophilum was evaluated by genotyping, using the 
16S rRNA, groEL, and msp2 gene sequences of the positive sample. BLASTn analysis 
revealed that the 16S rRNA, groEL, and msp2 genes had 99.6%, 99.9%, and 100%
identity with the following sequences deposited in GenBank: a cat 16S rRNA
sequence from Korea (KR021166), a rat groEL sequence from Korea (KT220194), and a
water deer msp2 sequence from Korea (HM752099), respectively. Phylogenetic
analyses classified the groEL gene into two distinct groups (serine and alanine),
whereas the msp2 gene showed a general classification into two groups (USA and
Europe) that were further subgrouped according to region. To the best of our
knowledge, this study is the first to describe the molecular diagnosis of A.
phagocytophilum in dogs reared in Korea. In addition, the high genetic identity
of the 16S rRNA and groEL sequences between humans and dogs from the same region 
suggests a possible epidemiological relation. Given the conditions of climate
change, tick ecology, and recent incidence of human granulocytic anaplasmosis in 
Korea, the findings of this study underscore the need to establish appropriate
control programs for tick-borne diseases in Korea.

Metabolic features and renal outcomes of urolithiasis in children.

Lee ST(1), Cho H(1).

Author information:

School of Medicine , Seoul , Republic of Korea.

AIM: The incidence of pediatric urolithiasis has increased over the last century 
because of dietary changes, metabolic abnormalities, climate change, and
genitourinary abnormalities. Data on pediatric urolithiasis in non-endemic
countries are limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical
findings and metabolic etiology of urolithiasis in Korean children.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The medical records of 73 Korean children who were newly
diagnosed with urolithiasis from January 2010 to December 2013 were
retrospectively analyzed. Evaluation of metabolic risk factors, including
hypercalciuria, hyperuricosuria, hypomagnesuria, hyperoxaluria, and
hypocitraturia, required analysis of 24-h urine specimens or, alternatively, for 
infants and toddlers, the solute-creatinine ratio in spot urine.
RESULTS: The male-to-female ratio of the included patients was 1.3:1. The median 
age at diagnosis was 10.1 years, and the patients were divided into two age
groups with pre-school-age children (n = 27, 37.0%) and school-age children
(n = 46, 63.0%). While flank pain was more common in school-age children,
incidentally detected or urinary tract infection (UTI)-associated urolithiasis
was more common in pre-school-age children. Eight patients (11.0%) had renal
function deterioration associated with urolithiasis, and three patients (4.1%)
progressed to chronic kidney disease. Metabolic abnormalities according to urine 
chemistry were found in 30 patients (41.1%), including hypercalciuria in 21.9%,
hyperuricosuria in 11.0%, hypomagnesuria in 4.1%, hyperoxaluria in 1.4%,
hypocitraturia in 1.4%, and cystinuria in 1.4%.
CONCLUSION: We suggest that school-age children with renal colic and
pre-school-age children with UTI should be evaluated for urolithiasis.
Additionally, the evaluation for metabolic risk factors is important in order to 
prevent recurrence and renal insufficiency.

Bacteria capable of reduction of nitrous oxide (N2O) to N2 separate into clade I 
and clade II organisms on the basis of nos operon structures and nosZ sequence
features. To explore the possible ecological consequences of distinct nos
clusters, the growth of bacterial isolates with either clade I (Pseudomonas
stutzeri strain DCP-Ps1, Shewanella loihica strain PV-4) or clade II
(Dechloromonas aromatica strain RCB, Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans strain 2CP-C) 
nosZ with N2O was examined. Growth curves did not reveal trends distinguishing
the clade I and clade II organisms tested; however, the growth yields of clade II
organisms exceeded those of clade I organisms by 1.5- to 1.8-fold. Further,
whole-cell half-saturation constants (Kss) for N2O distinguished clade I from
clade II organisms. The apparent Ks values of 0.324 ± 0.078 μM for D. aromatica
and 1.34 ± 0.35 μM for A. dehalogenans were significantly lower than the values
measured for P. stutzeri (35.5 ± 9.3 μM) and S. loihica (7.07 ± 1.13 μM). Genome 
sequencing demonstrated that Dechloromonas denitrificans possessed a clade II
nosZ gene, and a measured Ks of 1.01 ± 0.18 μM for N2O was consistent with the
values determined for the other clade II organisms tested. These observations
provide a plausible mechanistic basis for why the relative activity of bacteria
with clade I nos operons compared to that of bacteria with clade II nos operons
may control N2O emissions and determine a soil's N2O sink capacity.IMPORTANCE:
Anthropogenic activities, in particular fertilizer application for agricultural
production, increase N2O emissions to the atmosphere. N2O is a strong greenhouse 
gas with ozone destruction potential, and there is concern that nitrogen may
become the major driver of climate change. Microbial N2O reductase (NosZ)
catalyzes N2O reduction to environmentally benign dinitrogen gas and represents
the major N2O sink process. The observation that bacterial groups with clade I
nosZ versus those with clade II nosZ exhibit distinct affinities to N2O has
implications for N2O flux models, and these distinct characteristics may provide 
opportunities to curb N2O emissions from relevant soil ecosystems.

The fecundity and longevity ofAscotis selenaria(Denis & Schiffermüller 1775)
female adults were examined at constant temperatures ranging from 13-35°C. Adult 
longevity decreased as the temperature increased and ranged from 26.2 d at 13.1°C
to 5.2 d at 34.3°C. The maximum observed fecundity ofA. selenariawas 2,420 eggs
per female at 19.4°C, which decreased to ca 100 eggs per female at 34.3°C. Female
adult aging rates (one per median longevity) were well described by a sigmoid
equation in the range of 13-35°C used to calculate the physiological age of
adults. The relationship between total fecundity and temperature was well
described by an extreme value function. Age-specific cumulative oviposition rate 
and age-specific survival rate curve were fitted to a three-parameter Weibull
function. An oviposition model forA. selenariawas developed using the estimated
three temperature-dependent submodels: total fecundity, age-specific cumulative
oviposition, and age-specific survival rate models. The oviposition model was
simulated using pheromone catches ofA. selenariafemales as input value. Simulated
egg populations were subjected to egg stage emergence model to project
first-instar populations. Overall, the output of our simulation described the
field occurrence pattern ofA. selenariafirst-instar populations in 2009 and 2010.

BACKGROUND: Submerged rice paddy soils are the major anthropogenic source of
methane (CH4 ) emission to the atmosphere. Straw incorporation for sustaining
soil organic C pool increases CH4 emission flux from rice paddy soils. Though the
rate of nitrous oxide (N2 O) emission is much less than CH4 , the former has 298 
times higher global warming potential (GWP) than equivalent quantity of carbon
dioxide. The effect of chelating agents, such as EDTA, on N2 O emission and on
GWP due to CH4 and N2 O emissions has not been evaluated before.
RESULTS: The emission of CH4 gas from submerged soil may be mitigated by EDTA
application; however, it also increases concentration of nitrate-N in soil, the
precursor of N2 O gas formation under anaerobic condition. In this experiment,
irrespective of straw application, EDTA-treated soils emitted less CH4 to the
atmosphere than the corresponding control. Though N2 O emission was increased
from soil due to EDTA applications, total GWP was at least 15% reduced in EDTA
treated soils during rice cultivation. The plant growth and rice grain yield was 
not affected by EDTA application.
CONCLUSION: EDTA application at 5.0 ppm might be used to reduce total global
warming potential during rice cultivation. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.

OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to describe the regional malaria incidence
in relation to the geographic and climatic conditions and describe the effect of 
altitude on the expansion of malaria over the last decade in Papua New Guinea.
METHODS: Malaria incidence was estimated in five provinces from 1996 to 2008
using national health surveillance data. Time trend of malaria incidence was
compared with rainfall and minimum/maximum temperature. In the Eastern Highland
Province, time trend of malaria incidence over the study period was stratified by
altitude. Spatio-temporal pattern of malaria was analyzed.
RESULTS: Nationwide, malaria incidence was stationary. Regionally, the incidence 
increased markedly in the highland region (292.0/100000/yr, p =0.021), and
remained stationary in the other regions. Seasonality of the malaria incidence
was related with rainfall. Decreasing incidence of malaria was associated with
decreasing rainfall in the southern coastal region, whereas it was not evident in
the northern coastal region. In the Eastern Highland Province, malaria incidence 
increased in areas below 1700 m, with the rate of increase being steeper at
higher altitudes.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing trend of malaria incidence was prominent in the highland 
region of Papua New Guinea, while long-term trend was dependent upon baseline
level of rainfall in coastal regions.

The red seaweed Asparagopsis taxiformis embodies five cryptic mitochondrial
lineages (lineage 1-5) introduced worldwide as a consequence of human mediated
transport and climate change. We compared globally collected mitochondrial cox2-3
intergenic spacer sequences with sequences produced from multiple Australian
locations and South Korea to identify Asparagopsis lineages and to reveal cryptic
introductions. We report A. taxiformis lineage 4 from Cocos (Keeling) Islands,
Australia, and the highly invasive Indo-Pacific Mediterranean lineage 2 from
South Korea and Lord Howe Island, Australia. Phylogeographic analysis showed a
clear haplotype and geographic separation between western Australian and Great
Barrier Reef (GBR) isolates belonging to the recently described lineage 5. The
same lineage, however, was characterized by a substantial genetic and geographic 
break between the majority of Australian specimens and Asparagopsis collections
from South Solitary Island, Southern GBR, Lord Howe Island, Kermadec Islands,
Norfolk Island, New Caledonia and French Polynesia. The disjunct geographic
distribution and sequence divergence between these two groups supports the
recognition of a sixth cryptic A. taxiformis mitochondrial lineage. As climatic
changes accelerate the relocation of biota and offer novel niches for
colonization, periodic surveys for early detection of cryptic invasive seaweeds
will be critical in determining whether eradication or effective containment of
the aliens are feasible.

Hydrotalcites having a Mg/Al molar ratio between 3 and 30 have been synthesized
as promising high-temperature CO2 sorbents. The existence of NaNO3 in the
hydrotalcite structure, which originates from excess magnesium nitrate in the
precursor, markedly increases CO2 sorption uptake by hydrotalcite up to the
record high value of 9.27 mol kg(-1) at 240 °C and 1 atm CO2.

Arranging organisms into functional groups aids ecological research by grouping
organisms (irrespective of phylogenetic origin) that interact with environmental 
factors in similar ways. Planktonic protists traditionally have been split
between photoautotrophic "phytoplankton" and phagotrophic "microzooplankton".
However, there is a growing recognition of the importance of mixotrophy in
euphotic aquatic systems, where many protists often combine photoautotrophic and 
phagotrophic modes of nutrition. Such organisms do not align with the traditional
dichotomy of phytoplankton and microzooplankton. To reflect this understanding,
we propose a new functional grouping of planktonic protists in an
eco-physiological context: (i) phagoheterotrophs lacking phototrophic capacity,
(ii) photoautotrophs lacking phagotrophic capacity, (iii) constitutive mixotrophs
(CMs) as phagotrophs with an inherent capacity for phototrophy, and (iv)
non-constitutive mixotrophs (NCMs) that acquire their phototrophic capacity by
ingesting specific (SNCM) or general non-specific (GNCM) prey. For the first
time, we incorporate these functional groups within a foodweb structure and show,
using model outputs, that there is scope for significant changes in trophic
dynamics depending on the protist functional type description. Accordingly, to
better reflect the role of mixotrophy, we recommend that as important tools for
explanatory and predictive research, aquatic food-web and biogeochemical models
need to redefine the protist groups within their frameworks.

SUMMARY: Modern agriculture is facing multiple challenges including the necessity
for a substantial increase in production to meet the needs of a burgeoning human 
population. Water shortage is a deleterious consequence of both population growth
and climate change and is one of the most severe factors limiting global crop
productivity. Brassica species, particularly canola varieties, are cultivated
worldwide for edible oil, animal feed, and biodiesel, and suffer dramatic yield
loss upon drought stress. The recent release of the Brassica napus genome
supplies essential genetic information to facilitate identification of
drought-related genes and provides new information for agricultural improvement
in this species. Here we summarize current knowledge regarding drought responses 
of canola, including physiological and -omics effects of drought. We further
discuss knowledge gained through translational biology based on discoveries in
the closely related reference species Arabidopsis thaliana and through genetic
strategies such as genome-wide association studies and analysis of natural
variation. Knowledge of drought tolerance/resistance responses in canola together
with research outcomes arising from new technologies and methodologies will
inform novel strategies for improvement of drought tolerance and yield in this
and other important crop species.

Capture and conversion of CO2 to valuable chemicals is intended to answer global 
challenges on environmental issues, climate change and energy security.
Engineered cyanobacteria have been enabled to produce industry-relevant chemicals
from CO2 . However, the final products from cyanobacteria have often been mixed
with fermented metabolites during dark fermentation. In this study, our
engineering of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 enabled continuous conversion of 
CO2 to volatile acetone as sole product. This process occurred during lighted,
aerobic culture via both ATP-driven malonyl-CoA synthesis pathway and
heterologous phosphoketolase (PHK)-phosphotransacetylase (Pta) pathway. Because
of strong correlations between the metabolic pathways of acetate and acetone,
supplying the acetyl-CoA directly from CO2 in the engineered strain, led to sole 
production of acetone (22.48 mg/L ± 1.00) without changing nutritional
constraints, and without an anaerobic shift. Our engineered S. elongatus strains,
designed for acetone production, could be modified to create biosolar cell
factories for sustainable photosynthetic production of acetyl-CoA-derived
biochemicals.

Dimethyl sulphide (DMS) is an important compound in global atmospheric chemistry 
and climate change. Traceable international standards are essential for measuring
accurately the long-term global trend in ambient DMS. However, developing
accurate gas standards for sub-nanomole per mole (nmol/mol) mole fractions of DMS
in a cylinder is challenging, because DMS is reactive and unstable. In this
study, a dynamic dilution method that is traceable and precise was developed to
generate sub-nmol/mol DMS gas mixtures with a dynamic dilution system based on
sonic nozzles and a long-term (>5 years) stable 10 μmol/mol parent DMS primary
standard gas mixtures (PSMs). The dynamic dilution system was calibrated with
traceable methane PSMs, and its estimated dilution factors were used to calculate
the mole fractions of the dynamically generated DMS gas mixtures. A dynamically
generated DMS gas mixture and a 6 nmol/mol DMS PSM were analysed against each
other by gas chromatography with flame-ionisation detection (GC/FID) to evaluate 
the dilution system. The mole fractions of the dynamically generated DMS gas
mixture determined against a DMS PSM and calculated with the dilution factor
agreed within 1% at 6 nmol/mol. In addition, the dynamically generated DMS gas
mixtures at various mole fractions between 0.4 and 11.7 nmol/mol were analysed by
GC/FID and evaluated for their linearity. The analytically determined mole
fractions showed good linearity with the mole fractions calculated with the
dilution factors. Results showed that the dynamic dilution method generates DMS
gas mixtures ranging between 0.4 nmol/mol and 12 nmol/mol with relative expanded 
uncertainties of less than 2%. Therefore, the newly developed dynamic dilution
method is a promising reference method for generating sub-nmol/mol DMS gas
standards for accurate ambient measurements.

CONTEXT: Asian dust events are associated with increased asthma incidence, asthma
exacerbation, decreased lung function and increased risk for hospitalization.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of Asian dust
events on asthma exacerbation by socioeconomic status using national health
insurance claims data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-crossover design was used to analyze asthma-related
national health insurance claims, air pollutant and climate data from 2007 to
2013 in Seoul and Incheon, Korea. We stratified our analysis by socioeconomic
status (health insurance versus medical aid subscribers) and calculated the
maximum air pollutant levels and average climate values per day. The number of
asthma-related visits to medical institutions per day was compared between
"event" and "control" days.
RESULTS: Compared with "control days", the average number of asthma-related
visits to medical institutions decreased on "event" days and increased 1-5 d
thereafter. The number of visits by health insurance subscribers also decreased
on "event" days and increased 1-5 d thereafter, while the number of visits by
medical aid subscribers did not change on "event" days but increased 1-4 d
thereafter.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that Asian dust events result in an
increased number of asthma-related visits to medical institutions. This effect
differed by socioeconomic status.

Speculation surrounds the importance of ecologically cryptic Symbiodinium spp.
(dinoflagellates) that occur at low abundances in reef-building corals and in the
surrounding environment. Evidence acquired from extensive sampling, long-term
monitoring, and experimental manipulation can allow us to deduce the ecology and 
functional significance of these populations and whether they might contribute to
the response of coral-dinoflagellate mutualisms to climate change. Quantitative
PCR was used here to diagnose the prevalence, seasonal variation, and abundances 
of Symbiodinium spp. within and between colonies of the coral, Alveopora
japonica. Consistent with broader geographic sampling, only one species comprised
99.9 %, or greater, the population of symbionts in every sample. However, other
Symbiodinium including the non-mutualistic species, Symbiodinium voratum, were
often detected, but at estimated cell densities thousands-fold less than the
dominant symbiont. The temporal variation in prevalence and abundances of these
"background" Symbiodinium could not be definitively related to any particular
environmental factor including seasonality and water chemistry. The prevalence
(proportion detected among host samples), but not abundance, of S. voratum may
weakly correspond to increases in environmental inorganic silica (SiO2) and
possibly nitrogen (NO3). When multiple background Symbiodinium occurred within an
individual polyp, the average cell densities were positively correlated,
suggesting non-specific processes of cell sorting and retention by the animal.
While these findings substantiate the existence of a broader, yet
uncharacterized, diversity of Symbiodinium, we conclude that only those species
which can occur in high abundance and are temporally stable are ultimately
important to coral-dinoflagellate mutualisms. Many transient Symbiodinium spp.,
which occur only at trace abundances in the coral's microbiome, belong to
different functional guilds and likely have little, if any, importance to a
coral's physiology. The successful integration between host and symbiont into a
stable functional unit should therefore be considered when defining host-symbiont
specificity.

Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an acute mosquito-borne viral zoonotic disease that
affects mainly domestic ruminants and humans. RVF virus (RVFV) was first
identified in Kenya in 1931 and was reported to be endemic in Africa but has
recently spread to the Arabian Peninsula. With increasing climate change and
globalization of trade in animals and animal products, there is great concern
that the disease will spread worldwide to regions such as Europe, Asia, and the
Americas. Although RVFV has not been reported in the Republic of Korea (ROK), the
possibility of RVFV introduction is increasing because transmissible mosquito
vectors are present and direct flights to Africa were added in 2012. For these
reasons, we conducted a surveillance study to detect RVFV in mosquito vectors
collected around the airport and harbor from 2012 to 2013. A total of 36,734
mosquitoes were collected and tested by real-time RT-PCR. A total of 1837
mosquito pools were used, and all were confirmed to be negative. This is the
first report in the ROK concerning RVFV surveillance in mosquito vectors, and
continuous surveillance will be conducted for the early warning of RVFV
introduction.

The growing awareness of climate change/global warming, and continuing concerns
regarding stratospheric ozone depletion, will require continued measurements and 
standards for many compounds, in particular halocarbons that are linked to these 
issues. In order to track atmospheric mole fractions and assess the impact of
policy on emission rates, it is necessary to demonstrate measurement equivalence 
at the highest levels of accuracy for assigned values of standards. Precise
measurements of these species aid in determining small changes in their
atmospheric abundance. A common source of standards/scales and/or well-documented
agreement of different scales used to calibrate the measurement instrumentation
are key to understanding many sets of data reported by researchers. This report
describes the results of a comparison study among National Metrology Institutes
and atmospheric research laboratories for the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12), trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11), and
1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane (CFC-113); the hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)
chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22) and 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane (HCFC-142b); and 
the hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a), all in a dried 
whole air sample. The objective of this study is to compare calibration
standards/scales and the measurement capabilities of the participants for these
halocarbons at trace atmospheric levels. The results of this study show agreement
among four independent calibration scales to better than 2.5% in almost all
cases, with many of the reported agreements being better than 1.0%.

Butanol has been widely used as an important industrial solvent and feedstock for
chemical production. Also, its superior fuel properties compared with ethanol
make butanol a good substitute for gasoline. Butanol can be efficiently produced 
by the genus Clostridium through the acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation, 
one of the oldest industrial fermentation processes. Butanol production via
industrial fermentation has recently gained renewed interests as a potential
solution to increasing pressure of climate change and environmental problems by
moving away from fossil fuel consumption and moving toward renewable raw
materials. Great advances over the last 100 years are now reviving interest in
bio-based butanol production. However, several challenges to industrial
production of butanol still need to be overcome, such as overall cost
competitiveness and development of higher performance strains with greater
butanol tolerance. This minireview revisits the past 100 years of remarkable
achievements made in fermentation technologies, product recovery processes, and
strain development in clostridial butanol fermentation through overcoming major
technical hurdles.

In this study, a cDNA library was constructed from the total RNA of sweet potato 
leaves. A total of 789 copies of the cDNA were cloned in Escherichia coli by
employing the pGEM-T Easy vector. Sequencing was carried out by Solgent Co.
(Korea). As many as 579 expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR)
markers were designed (73.38%) from the known cDNA nucleotide base sequences. The
lengths of the developed EST-SSR markers ranged from 100 to 499 bp (average
length 238 bp). Their motif sequence types were varied, with most being
dinucleotides and pentanucleotides, and the most commonly found motifs were
CAGAAT (29.0%) and TCT (2.8%). Based on these SSR-containing sequences, 619 pairs
of high-quality SSR primers were designed using WebSat and Primer3web. The total 
number of primers designed was 144. Polymorphism was evident in 82 EST-SSR
markers among 20 Korean sweet potato cultivars tested and in 90 EST-SSR markers
in the two parents of a mapping population, Yeseumi and Annobeny. In this study, 
the hexaploid sweet potato (2n = 6x = 90) EST-SSR markers were developed in the
absence of full-sequence data. Moreover, by acting as a molecular tag for
particular traits, the EST-SSR marker can also simultaneously identify
information about the corresponding gene. These EST-SSR markers will allow the
molecular analysis of sweet potato to be done more efficiently. Thus, we can
develop high-quality sweet potato while overcoming the challenges from climate
change and other unfavorable conditions.

Despite the recent considerable progress, the reversibility and cycle life of
silicon anodes in lithium-ion batteries are yet to be improved further to meet
the commercial standards. The current major industry, instead, adopts silicon
monoxide (SiOx, x ≈ 1), as this phase can accommodate the volume change of
embedded Si nanodomains via the silicon oxide matrix. However, the poor Coulombic
efficiencies (CEs) in the early period of cycling limit the content of SiOx,
usually below 10 wt % in a composite electrode with graphite. Here, we introduce 
a scalable but delicate prelithiation scheme based on electrical shorting with
lithium metal foil. The accurate shorting time and voltage monitoring allow a
fine-tuning on the degree of prelithiation without lithium plating, to a level
that the CEs in the first three cycles reach 94.9%, 95.7%, and 97.2%. The
excellent reversibility enables robust full-cell operations in pairing with an
emerging nickel-rich layered cathode, Li[Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05]O2, even at a
commercial level of initial areal capacity of 2.4 mAh cm(-2), leading to a full
cell energy density 1.5-times as high as that of graphite-LiCoO2 counterpart in
terms of the active material weight.

The geographical distributions and relative population densities of scrub typhus 
vector mites collected from small mammals were determined for 5 locations on the 
east coast of the Republic of Korea. Collection sites included Goseong,
Gangneung, and Hoengseong in Gangwon province and Uljin and Yeongdeok in
Gyeongbuk province. A total of 275 small mammals including members of Rodentia
(rodents) and Soricomorpha (shrews, such as Crocidura lasiura ) belonging to 4
genera and 4 species were captured in the field from 2012 to 2013. Apodemus
agrarius was collected most frequently (220, 80%), followed by C. lasiura (25,
9.1%), Mus musculus (15, 5.5%), and Myodes regulus (15, 5.5%). A total of 23,436 
larval chigger mites (Family Trombiculidae) belonging to 3 genera and 8 species
(Leptotrombidium pallidum, Leptotrombidium scutellare, Leptotrombidium palpale,
Leptotrombidium orientale, Leptotrombidium zetum, Neotrombicula tamiyai,
Neotrombicula japonica, and Euschoengastica koreaensis) were collected from the
small mammals. The predominant chigger species collected during the spring and
fall seasons from A. agrarius were L. pallidum (57.6%), L. palpale (14.5%), and
L. scutellare (7.9%). Leptotrombidium scutellare was collected only along the
southeastern coast at Yeongdeok, Gyeongbuk province. The geographical
distribution of scrub typhus vectors and reservoir hosts are important aspects of
understanding the epidemiology of the disease as well as the potential impacts of
climate change and health risks.

We measured the carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations in the marine boundary layer 
and the surface waters of the Atlantic Ocean from 50°N to 50°S during the UK
Atlantic Meridional Transect expedition (AMT-7) in October 1998, covering the
open ocean and coastal regions. Throughout the cruise track, atmospheric CO
concentrations continually decreased southwards in the northern hemisphere with
sporadic low and high concentrations encountered. South of the intertropical
convergence zone (ITCZ) atmospheric CO was enhanced by ∼10 ppb compared to north 
of the ITCZ due likely to biomass burning emissions prevailing in the tropical
continents. The remainder of the southern hemisphere remains nearly invariable
except for the vicinity of Rio de la Plata. The surface seawater was
supersaturated everywhere along the track and its saturation anomaly oscillated
up to 90, exhibiting a typical diurnal cycle. The maximal dissolved CO
concentration in the diurnal cycle appeared 2-5 hours behind the local maximum of
solar insolation in the open ocean and the time lag further increased in the
coastal region. The global ocean flux of CO to the atmosphere was estimated to be
14 Tg(CO) a(-1) within the range of 4-24 Tg(CO) a(-1). This is within uncertainty
almost identical to what was estimated on the basis of the basin-wide
observations in the Pacific and the Atlantic, but more than ∼4 times lower than
the values appeared in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
reports.

One of the main challenges in phytoplankton ecology is to understand their
variability at different spatiotemporal scales. We investigated the interannual
and cyclone-derived variability in phytoplankton communities of Chilika, the
largest tropical coastal lagoon in Asia and the underlying mechanisms in relation
to environmental forcing. Between July 2012 and June 2013, Cyanophyta were most
prolific in freshwater northern region of the lagoon. A category-5 very severe
cyclonic storm (VSCS) Phailin struck the lagoon on 12th October 2013 and
introduced additional variability into the hydrology and phytoplankton
communities. Freshwater Cyanophyta further expanded their territory and occupied 
the northern as well as central region of the lagoon. Satellite remote sensing
imagery revealed that the phytoplankton biomass did not change much due to high
turbidity prevailing in the lagoon after Phailin. Modeling analysis of
species-salinity relationship identified specific responses of phytoplankton taxa
to the different salinity regime of lagoon.

Prevailing theories on the equatorial Atlantic Niño are based on the dynamical
interaction between atmosphere and ocean. However, dynamical coupled
ocean-atmosphere models poorly simulate and predict equatorial Atlantic climate
variability. Here we use multi-model numerical experiments to show that
thermodynamic feedbacks excited by stochastic atmospheric perturbations can
generate Atlantic Niño s.d. of ∼0.28±0.07 K, explaining ∼68±23% of the observed
interannual variability. Thus, in state-of-the-art coupled models, Atlantic Niño 
variability strongly depends on the thermodynamic component (R(2)=0.92). Coupled 
dynamics acts to improve the characteristic Niño-like spatial structure but not
necessarily the variance. Perturbations of the equatorial Atlantic trade winds
(∼±1.53 m s(-1)) can drive changes in surface latent heat flux (∼±14.35 W m(-2)) 
and thus in surface temperature consistent with a first-order autoregressive
process. By challenging the dynamical paradigm of equatorial Atlantic
variability, our findings suggest that the current theories on its modelling and 
predictability must be revised.

The Western North Pacific Subtropical High (WNPSH) regulates East Asian climate
in summer. Anomalous WNPSH causes floods, droughts and heat waves in China, Japan
and Korea. The potential change of the WNPSH under global warming is concerned by
Asian people, but whether the WNPSH would be enhanced or weakened remains
inconclusive. Based on the multi-model climate change projection from the 5th
phase of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), we show evidences that
the WNPSH tends to weaken and retreat eastward in the mid-troposphere in response
to global warming, accompanied by an eastward expansion of East Asian rain belt
along the northwestern flank of WNPSH. Weakened meridional temperature gradient
on the northern flank of WNPSH and the associated thermal wind account for the
weakened WNPSH in the mid troposphere. We recommend the WNPSH be measured by eddy
geopotential height (He) instead of traditionally used geopotential height,
especially in climate change studies.

By using the ILSI network in Asia, we are holding a session focused on food
safety programs in several Asian areas. In view of the external environment, it
is expected to impact the global food system in the near future, including the
rapid increase in food demand and in public health services due to population
growth, as well as the threats to biosecurity and food safety due to the rapid
globalization of the food trade. Facilitating effective information sharing holds
promise for the activation of the food industry. At this session, Prof. Hwang
shares the current situation of Food Safety and Sanitation Regulations in Taiwan.
Dr. Liu provides a talk on the role of risk assessment in food regulatory control
focused on aluminum-containing food additives in China. After the JECFA
evaluation of aluminum-containing food additives in 2011, each country has
carried out risk assessment based on dietary intake surveys. Ms. Chan reports on 
the activities of a working group on Food Standards Harmonization in ASEAN. She
also explains that the ILSI Southeast Asia Region has actively supported the
various ASEAN Working Groups in utilizing science to harmonize food standards.
Prof. Park provides current research activities in Korea focused on the effect of
climate change on food safety. Climate change is generally seen as having a
negative impact on food security, particularly in developing countries. We use
these four presentations as a springboard to vigorous discussion on issues
related to Food Safety in Asia.

In this study, the environmental adaptive metabolic processes were investigated
using a psychrotrophic polar bacterium Bacillus pumilus PAMC 23174 in response to
various temperatures and nutrients, especially in regard to the synthesis of
fatty acids. Fatty acid methyl ester analysis was performed using gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry and we found that a sensitive changes in
iso-branched fatty acid (iso-15:0) synthesis occurred when adjusting the
nutritional ratio of branched chain fatty acids (anteiso/iso) with different
temperatures, resulting in a change in the balance of anteiso- and iso-form fatty
acids. We also observed that this Arctic bacterium preferred amino acid leucine
for the synthesis of fatty acids. The increased and decreased synthesis of
iso-form fatty acids in response to different temperatures and leucine
preference, changes the fatty acid ratio in bacteria, which further affects the
membrane fluidity and it is also directly correlated with survival of bacteria in
an extreme environment. Hence, this study suggests that B. pumilus PAMC 23174 is 
a potential model organism for the analysis of the unique ecological adaptations 
of polar bacteria in changing and the extreme environments.

Few studies have examined how the precedence of abnormal temperatures in previous
neighboring years affects the population's health. In the present study, we
attempted to quantify the health effects of abnormal weather patterns by creating
a metric called the temperature deviation index (TDI) and estimated the effects
of TDI on mortality in Japan. We used data from 47 prefectures in Japan to
compute the TDI on days between May and September from 1966 to 2010. The TDI is a
summed product of an indicator of absence of high temperatures in the neighboring
years, and more weights were assigned to the years closest to the current year.
To estimate the TDI effects on elderly mortality, we used generalized linear
modeling with a Poisson distribution after adjusting for apparent temperature,
barometric pressure, day of the week, and time trend. For each prefecture, we
estimated the TDI effects and pooled the estimates to yield a national average
for 1991-2010 in Japan. The estimated effects of TDI in middle- or high-latitude 
prefectures were greater than in low-latitude prefectures. The estimated national
average of TDI effects was a 0.5 % (95 % confidence intervals [CI], 0.1, 1.0)
increase in elderly mortality per 1-unit (around 1 standard deviation) increase
in the TDI. The significant pooled estimation of TDI effects was mainly due to
the TDI effects on summer days with moderate temperature (25th-49th percentile,
mean temperature 22.9 °C): a 1.9 % (95 % CI, 1.1, 2.6) increase in elderly
mortality per 1-unit increase in the TDI. However, TDI effects were insignificant
in other temperature ranges. These findings suggest that elderly deaths increased
on moderate temperature days in the summer that differed substantially from days 
during that time window in the neighboring years. Therefore, not only high
temperature itself but also temperature deviation compared to previous years
could be considered to be a risk factor for elderly mortality in the summer.

Monochamus saltuarius Gebler is a vector that transmits the pine wood nematode,
Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, to Korean white pine, Pinus koraiensis, in Korea. To 
reduce the damage caused by this nematode in pine forests, timely control
measures are needed to suppress the cerambycid beetle population. This study
sought to construct a forecasting model to predict beetle emergence based on
spring temperature. Logs of Korean white pine were infested with M. saltuarius in
2009, and the infested logs were overwintered. In February 2010, infested logs
were then moved into incubators held at constant temperature conditions of 16,
20, 23, 25, 27, 30 or 34°C until all adults had emerged. The developmental rate
of the beetles was estimated by linear and nonlinear equations and a forecasting 
model for emergence of the beetle was constructed by pooling data based on
normalized developmental rate. The lower threshold temperature for development
was 8.3°C. The forecasting model relatively well predicted the emergence pattern 
of M. saltuarius collected from four areas in northern Republic of Korea. The
median emergence dates predicted by the model were 2.2-5.9 d earlier than the
observed median dates.

Coastal lands and nearshore marine areas are productive and rapidly changing
places. However, these areas face many environmental challenges related to
climate change and human-induced impacts. Space-borne remote sensing systems may 
be restricted in monitoring these areas because of their spatial and temporal
resolutions. In situ measurements are also constrained from accessing the area
and obtaining wide-coverage data. In these respects, airborne remote sensing
sensors could be the most appropriate tools for monitoring these coastal areas.
In this study, a cost-effective airborne remote sensing system with synthetic
aperture radar and thermal infrared sensors was implemented to survey coastal
areas. Calibration techniques and geophysical model algorithms were developed for
the airborne system to observe the topography of intertidal flats, coastal sea
surface current, sea surface temperature, and submarine groundwater discharge.

Infections of plants by multiple viruses are common in nature and may result in
synergisms in pathologies. Several environmental factors influence plant-virus
interactions and act on virulence and host defense responses. Mixed viral
infections may be more frequent under environmental conditions associated with
global warming. Here, we address how changes in the two main parameters behind
global warming, carbon dioxide concentrations ([CO₂]) and temperature, may affect
virulence of Potato virus X (PVX)/potyvirus-associated synergism compared with
single infections in Nicotiana benthamiana. Elevated [CO₂] resulted in attenuated
virulence of single infection by PVX, which correlated with a lower accumulation 
of virus. In contrast, virulence of PVX/potyvirus-associated synergism was
maintained at elevated [CO₂]. On the other hand, elevated temperature decreased
markedly both virulence and virus titers in the synergistic infection. We also
show that the HR-like response elicited by transient coexpression of PVX P25
together with the potyviral helper component-proteinase protein was significantly
enhanced by elevated temperature, whereas it was reduced by elevated [CO₂]. Both 
proteins are main pathogenicity determinants in PVX-associated synergisms. These 
findings indicate that, under environmental conditions associated with global
warming, virulence of PVX/potyvirus-associated synergisms is expected to vary
relative to single infections and, thus, may have pathological consequences in
the future.

It has often been claimed that non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases (NCGGs), such 
as methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated greenhouse gases, are significant
contributors to climate change. Here we nvestigate emission estimates of methane 
and nitrous oxide from livestock and poultry production, which is recognized as a
major source of those NCGGs, in Korea over the period of 1990 through 2010. Based
on the data on livestock and poultry populations, emission estimates of methane
and nitrous oxide are first derived based on the Tier 1 approach. Then, the Tier 
2 approach is adopted to obtain emission estimates of methane and nitrous oxide
from cattle, which are known to be the largest sources of these NCGGs and account
for about 70% of emissions from livestock and poultry in Korea. The result
indicates that the Tier 2 estimates of methane and nitrous oxide emissions from
enteric fermentation and manure management are significantly different from the
Tier 1 estimates over the analysis period.

The increasing prevalence of social networks provides researchers greater
opportunities to evaluate and assess changes in public opinion and public
sentiment towards issues of social consequence. Using trend and sentiment
analysis is one method whereby researchers can identify changes in public
perception that can be used to enhance the development of a social consciousness 
towards a specific public interest. The following study assessed Relative search 
volume (RSV) patterns for global warming (GW) and Climate change (CC) to
determine public knowledge and awareness of these terms. In conjunction with
this, the researchers looked at the sentiment connected to these terms in social 
media networks. It was found that there was a relationship between the awareness 
of the information and the amount of publicity generated around the terminology. 
Furthermore, the primary driver for the increase in awareness was an increase in 
publicity in either a positive or a negative light. Sentiment analysis further
confirmed that the primary emotive connections to the words were derived from the
original context in which the word was framed. Thus having awareness or knowledge
of a topic is strongly related to its public exposure in the media, and the
emotional context of this relationship is dependent on the context in which the
relationship was originally established. This has value in fields like
conservation, law enforcement, or other fields where the practice can and often
does have two very strong emotive responses based on the context of the problems 
being examined.

Global climate change brings with it unwarranted shifts in both abiotic (heat
stress, cold stress, wind, precipitation) and biotic (pathogens, pests)
environmental factors, thus posing a threat to agricultural productivity across
the world. In plants, lodging due to storms or herbivory causes wounding stress
and consequently enhances endogenous jasmonates. In response, the plant growth is
arrested as plant defense is prioritized. We pre-treated pea plants with elevated
methyl jasmonate (MeJA) levels i.e. 50 μM, 100 μM and 200 μM under controlled
growth chamber conditions. The pre-treated plants were then kept at 40 °C (heat
stress--HS), 4 °C (cold stress--CS) and 20 °C (optimum/control temperature--OT)
for 72 h. The effect of such treatments on plant growth attributes,
photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, cell death rate, and regulation of
endogenous hormones were observed. Elevated MeJA application hindered plant
growth attributes under HS, CS and OT conditions. Moreover, elevated MeJA levels 
lowered the rate of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, induced stomatal
closure, caused higher cells mortality in leaves under HS, CS, and OT conditions.
Endogenous ABA contents significantly declined in all MeJA treatments under HS
and OT, but increased under CS conditions. Exogenous MeJA enhanced endogenous
jasmonic acid contents of pea plants, but altered endogenous salicylic acid
contents under varying temperatures. Current study shows that higher
concentrations of exogenous MeJA strengthen plant defense mechanism by hindering 
plant growth under stress conditions.

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from the offshore fisheries industry in the
Republic of Korea (Korea) were examined in response to growing concerns about
global warming and the contribution of emissions from different industrial
sectors. Fuel usage and GHG emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O) were analysed using the
'Tier 1' method provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
from the offshore fishery, which is the primary domestic seafood production
sector in Korea. In 2013, fuel usage in the offshore fishery accounted for 59.7% 
(557,463 KL) of total fuel consumption of fishing vessels in Korea. Fuel
consumption and thus GHG emissions were not stable through time in this industry,
increasing by 2.4% p.a. for three consecutive years, from 2011 to 2013, despite a
decrease in the number of vessels operating. GHG emissions generated in offshore 
fisheries also changed through time and increased from 1,442,975 tCO2e/year in
2011 to 1,477,279 tCO2e/year in 2013. Changes in both fuel use and GHG emissions 
per kg offshore fish production appeared to be associated with decreasing catch
rates by the fleet, which in turn were a reflection of decrease in fish biomass. 
Another important feature of GHG emissions in this industry was the high
variation in GHG emission per kg fish product among different fishing methods.
The long line fishery had approximately three times the emissions of the average 
production while the jigging fishery was more than two times higher than the
average. Lowest emissions were from the trawl sector, which is regarded as having
greatest environmental impact using traditional biodiversity metrics although had
lowest environmental impact in terms of fuel and GHG emission metrics used in
this study. The observed deterioration in fuel efficiency of the offshore fishery
each year is of concern but also demonstrates that fuel efficiency can change,
which shows there is opportunity to improve efficiency with changes to fishery
management and harvesting operations.

X (PVX) vector, the latter either unaltered or expressing the CMV 2b protein or
the PVY HCPro suppressors of silencing, at 25°C vs. 30°C, or at standard (~401
parts per million, ppm) vs. elevated (970 ppm) CO2 levels. We also assessed the
activities of their suppressors of silencing under those conditions. We found
that at 30°C, accumulation of the CMV isolate and infection symptoms remained
comparable to those at 25°C, whereas accumulation of the PVY isolate and those of
the three PVX constructs decreased markedly, even when expressing the
heterologous suppressors 2b or HCPro, and plants had either very attenuated or no
symptoms. Under elevated CO2 plants grew larger, but contained less total
protein/unit of leaf area. In contrast to temperature, infection symptoms
remained unaltered for the five viruses at elevated CO2 levels, but viral titers 
in leaf disks as a proportion of the total protein content increased in all
cases, markedly for CMV, and less so for PVY and the PVX constructs. Despite
these differences, we found that neither high temperature nor elevated CO2
prevented efficient suppression of silencing by their viral suppressors in
agropatch assays. Our results suggest that the strength of antiviral silencing at
high temperature or CO2 levels, or those of the viral suppressors that counteract
it, may not be the main determinants of the observed infection outcomes.

A dark-pink-coloured bacterial strain, B4Y-8T, was isolated from a soil
cultivated with ginseng. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of this strain showed highest
similarity with Mucilaginibacter litoreus BR-18T (96.8 %), Mucilaginibacter
lutimaris BR-3T (96.6 %) and Mucilaginibacter defluvii A5T (96.2 %) among the
type strains of species of the genus Mucilaginibacter. Strain B4Y-8T was a
strictly aerobic, Gram-stain-negative, non-motile, short-rod-shaped bacterium
producing a large amount of extracellular polymeric substance. The strain grew at
10-35 °C (optimum, 25 °C), at pH 3.0-11.0 (optimum, pH 7.0) and in the presence
of 0-1 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0 %). The DNA G+C content of strain B4Y-8T was
49.0 mol%. It contained menaquinone 7 (MK-7) as the major isoprenoid quinone, and
summed feature 3 (C16 : 1ω6c and/or C16 : 1ω7c) and iso-C15 : 0 as the major
fatty acids. On the basis of evidence from the present polyphasic taxonomic
study, strain B4Y-8T should be classified as representing a novel species of the 
genus Mucilaginibacter, for which the name Mucilaginibacter ginsengisoli sp. nov.
is proposed. The type strain is B4Y-8T ( = KACC 18152T = JCM 30759T).

Climate change has caused shifts in species' ranges and extinctions of
high-latitude and altitude species. Most cold-tolerant evergreen broadleaved
woody plants (shortened to cold-evergreens below) are rare species occurring in a
few sites in the alpine and subalpine zones in the Korean Peninsula. The aim of
this research is to 1) identify climate factors controlling the range of
cold-evergreens in the Korean Peninsula; and 2) predict the climate change
effects on the range of cold-evergreens. We used multimodel inference based on
combinations of climate variables to develop distribution models of
cold-evergreens at a physiognomic-level. Presence/absence data of 12 species at
204 sites and 6 climatic factors, selected from among 23 candidate variables,
were used for modeling. Model uncertainty was estimated by mapping a total
variance calculated by adding the weighted average of within-model variation to
the between-model variation. The range of cold-evergreens and model performance
were validated by true skill statistics, the receiver operating characteristic
curve and the kappa statistic. Climate change effects on the cold-evergreens were
predicted according to the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. Multimodel inference
approach excellently projected the spatial distribution of cold-evergreens (AUC =
0.95, kappa = 0.62 and TSS = 0.77). Temperature was a dominant factor in
model-average estimates, while precipitation was minor. The climatic suitability 
increased from the southwest, lowland areas, to the northeast, high mountains.
The range of cold-evergreens declined under climate change. Mountain-tops in the 
south and most of the area in the north remained suitable in 2050 and 2070 under 
the RCP 4.5 projection and 2050 under the RCP 8.5 projection. Only
high-elevations in the northeastern Peninsula remained suitable under the RCP 8.5
projection. A northward and upper-elevational range shift indicates change in
species composition at the alpine and subalpine ecosystems in the Korean
Peninsula.

Environmental problems and climate change arising from waste incineration are
taken quite seriously in the world. In Korea, the waste disposal methods are
largely classified into landfill, incineration, recycling, etc. and the amount of
incinerated waste has risen by 24.5% from 2002. In the analysis of CO₂emissions
estimations of waste incinerators fossil carbon content are main factor by the
IPCC. FCF differs depending on the characteristics of waste in each country, and 
a wide range of default values are proposed by the IPCC. This study conducted
research on the existing classifications of the IPCC and Korean waste
classification systems based on FCF for accurate greenhouse gas emissions
estimation of waste incineration. The characteristics possible for sorting were
classified according to FCF and form. The characteristics sorted according to
fossil carbon fraction were paper, textiles, rubber, and leather. Paper was
classified into pure paper and processed paper; textiles were classified into
cotton and synthetic fibers; and rubber and leather were classified into
artificial and natural. The analysis of FCF was implemented by collecting
representative samples from each classification group, by applying the 14C
method, and using AMS equipment. And the analysis values were compared with the
default values proposed by the IPCC. In this study of garden and park waste and
plastics, the differences were within the range of the IPCC default values or the
differences were negligible. However, coated paper, synthetic textiles, natural
rubber, synthetic rubber, artificial leather, and other wastes showed differences
of over 10% in FCF content. IPCC is comprised of largely 9 types of qualitative
classifications, in emissions estimation a great difference can occur from the
combined characteristics according with the existing IPCC classification system
by using the minutely classified waste characteristics as in this
study.IMPLICATIONS: Fossil carbon fraction (FCF) differs depending on the
characteristics of waste in each country; and a wide range of default values are 
proposed by the IPCC. This study conducted research on the existing
classifications of the IPCC and Korean waste classification systems based on FCF 
for accurate greenhouse gas emissions estimation of waste incineration.

The prevalence of allergic airway diseases such as asthma and rhinitis has
increased dramatically to epidemic proportions worldwide. Besides air pollution
from industry derived emissions and motor vehicles, the rising trend can only be 
explained by gross changes in the environments where we live. The world economy
has been transformed over the last 25 years with developing countries being at
the core of these changes. Around the planet, in both developed and developing
countries, environments are undergoing profound changes. Many of these changes
are considered to have negative effects on respiratory health and to enhance the 
frequency and severity of respiratory diseases such as asthma in the general
population. Increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, and especially carbon
dioxide (CO2), in the atmosphere have already warmed the planet substantially,
causing more severe and prolonged heat waves, variability in temperature,
increased air pollution, forest fires, droughts, and floods - all of which can
put the respiratory health of the public at risk. These changes in climate and
air quality have a measurable impact not only on the morbidity but also the
mortality of patients with asthma and other respiratory diseases. The massive
increase in emissions of air pollutants due to economic and industrial growth in 
the last century has made air quality an environmental problem of the first order
in a large number of regions of the world. A body of evidence suggests that major
changes to our world are occurring and involve the atmosphere and its associated 
climate. These changes, including global warming induced by human activity, have 
an impact on the biosphere, biodiversity, and the human environment. Mitigating
this huge health impact and reversing the effects of these changes are major
challenges. This statement of the World Allergy Organization (WAO) raises the
importance of this health hazard and highlights the facts on climate-related
health impacts, including: deaths and acute morbidity due to heat waves and
extreme meteorological events; increased frequency of acute cardio-respiratory
events due to higher concentrations of ground level ozone; changes in the
frequency of respiratory diseases due to trans-boundary particle pollution;
altered spatial and temporal distribution of allergens (pollens, molds, and
mites); and some infectious disease vectors. According to this report, these
impacts will not only affect those with current asthma but also increase the
incidence and prevalence of allergic respiratory conditions and of asthma. The
effects of climate change on respiratory allergy are still not well defined, and 
more studies addressing this topic are needed. Global warming is expected to
affect the start, duration, and intensity of the pollen season on the one hand,
and the rate of asthma exacerbations due to air pollution, respiratory
infections, and/or cold air inhalation, and other conditions on the other hand.

BACKGROUND: This study attempted to measure the environmental burden of disease
by examining mortality and disability rates in South Korea, permitting
international comparisons.
METHODS: Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) was used to analyze data from
public records. Years of life lost (YLL) and years lost to disability (YLD) were 
measured in terms of incidence rate and number of deaths. Attributable risks were
based on those for WHO Western Pacific Regions. For air pollution, attributable
risk was calculated using local PM10 levels and relative risk.
RESULTS: The total Korean environmental burden of disease was 17.98 per 1000
persons and the most serious risk factor was air pollution, at 6.89 per 1000
persons. Occupation was the second highest contributing factor, at 3.29 per 1000 
persons, followed by indoor air pollution at 2.91 per 1000 persons. The DALY of
air-pollution (indoor and outdoor) was 9.80 per 1000 persons, accounting for more
than half of the total environmental burden of disease. The burden of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and asthma were 4.07, 3.16, and 1.96 
per 1000 persons, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory illnesses comprised most of the disease burden, the
majority of which was linked to air pollution. The present results are important 
as they could be used to make evidence-based decisions regarding the management
of diseases and environmental-risk factors.

In the Arctic, climate warming enhances vegetation activity by extending the
length of the growing season and intensifying maximum rates of productivity. In
turn, increased vegetation productivity reduces albedo, which causes a positive
feedback on temperature. Over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), regional vegetation
greening has also been observed in response to recent warming. Here, we show that
in contrast to arctic regions, increased growing season vegetation activity over 
the TP may have attenuated surface warming. This negative feedback on growing
season vegetation temperature is attributed to enhanced evapotranspiration (ET). 
The extra energy available at the surface, which results from lower albedo, is
efficiently dissipated by evaporative cooling. The net effect is a decrease in
daily maximum temperature and the diurnal temperature range, which is supported
by statistical analyses of in situ observations and by decomposition of the
surface energy budget. A daytime cooling effect from increased vegetation
activity is also modeled from a set of regional weather research and forecasting 
(WRF) mesoscale model simulations, but with a magnitude smaller than observed,
likely because the WRF model simulates a weaker ET enhancement. Our results
suggest that actions to restore native grasslands in degraded areas, roughly
one-third of the plateau, will both facilitate a sustainable ecological
development in this region and have local climate cobenefits. More accurate
simulations of the biophysical coupling between the land surface and the
atmosphere are needed to help understand regional climate change over the TP, and
possible larger scale feedbacks between climate in the TP and the Asian monsoon
system.

Global change has already had observable effects on ecosystems worldwide, and the
accelerated rate of global change is predicted in the future. However, the
impacts of global change on the stability of biodiversity have not been
systematically studied in terms of both large spatial (continental drift) and
temporal (from the last inter-glacial period to the next century) scales.
Therefore, we analyzed the current geographical distribution pattern of
Plecoptera, a thermally sensitive insect group, and evaluated its stability when 
coping with global change across both space and time throughout the Mediterranean
region--one of the first 25 global biodiversity hotspots. Regional biodiversity
of Plecoptera reflected the geography in both the historical movements of
continents and the current environmental conditions in the western Mediterranean 
region. The similarity of Plecoptera assemblages between areas in this region
indicated that the uplift of new land and continental drift were the primary
determinants of the stability of regional biodiversity. Our results revealed that
climate change caused the biodiversity of Plecoptera to slowly diminish in the
past and will cause remarkably accelerated biodiversity loss in the future. These

Forty-year (1971-2010) observations of cloud cover and types have been analyzed, 
and implications on the effects of aerosol-cloud feedback were explored. Cloud
cover and types have been observed over Korea on the basis of visible (human-eye)
attributes without any change in official observing instructions. Visibility has 
been used as an ongoing proxy measure of aerosol concentrations, and observed
meteorological variables such as sunshine duration and precipitation have been
employed to analyze aerosol causes and implications for urban and regional
climate. The analysis revealed persistent decade-long patterns in Korea: steadily
reduced visibility (-0.37 km/yr), consistently decreasing sunshine duration
(-0.06 %/hr), and declining occurrence of light precipitation. Spatial
distributions of sunshine duration and visibility exhibited more localized
variations in the early period (1971-1990), and tended to be more uniform
throughout Korea over more recent years (1991-2010), implying the recent
regional-scale impact of cloud change over northeast Asia. Cloud analysis results
showed that the five most common types were stratocumulus (Sc), cirrus (Ci),
altostratus (As), stratus (St), and nimbostratus (Ns), with occurrences of 33%,
17%, 17%, 9%, and 8%, respectively. Occurrence of rarely precipitating or
nonprecipitating low-level Sc clouds showed an increasing (+0.34%/yr), but no (or
only minor) effects of aerosols on heavy precipitation such as cumulus cloud
types were found. Cloud cover in the range of 6/10 to 8/10 units has increased by
31.5±6.5%, and occurrences of both cloud-free (~2/10 units) and overcast (~8/10
units) conditions have decreased.IMPLICATIONS: Aerosol-cloud-precipitations
interaction is highly nonlinear due to feedback mechanisms. One reason for our
poor understanding of the aerosol-cloud feedback study is the variety of cloud
types with their complicated responses to variations of the aerosol. Our study on
the response of precipitation-cloud to long-term anthropogenic aerosols over 40
years (1971-2010) in South Korea demonstrated that recent changes tend to be at a
regional scale, and change in stratocumulus clouds is the most significant. In
addition, the changes in cloud-relevant meteorological variables such as sunshine
duration and light precipitation were not consistent with expected local
anthropogenic aerosol after 1990, implying the importance of long range
transboundary influence on a regional or larger than urban scale over the recent 
years in the northeast Asian region.

Korea.

OBJECTIVES: Literature on the effect of birth month on height has generally
considered regions in temperate climates. However, because many climatic
conditions there change with seasons, it is difficult to isolate potential
causes. This study estimated the effect of birth month and season on terminal
height by analyzing the population of a country with only a few factors driving
its climate.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample was derived from nationally representative data
of the Indonesian population. We considered 9,262 men and 10,314 women 20-50
years of age. We applied cosinor analysis to a time series of height by birth
month. We then applied a more flexible approach by regressing height on a series 
of dummy variables for birth month (and, subsequently, season) and birth year
fixed effects by sex.
RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in height by birth
month. However, although weakly significant, men born in the dry season
(June-September) were 2.3 mm shorter than those born in the wet season (the
remaining months). The corresponding figure for women was 2.6 mm, a statistically
significant difference.
DISCUSSION: We eliminated some potential factors previously suggested in the
literature, including insolation, the position of our planet with respect to the 
sun, food availability, and maternal workload. We speculate that babies born in
the dry season were affected in the third trimester by the high disease burden
that characterizes the wet season.

In the rapidly growing economies of Asia and Oceania, food security has become a 
primary concern. With the rising population, growing more food at affordable
prices is becoming even more important. In addition, the predicted climate change
will lead to drastic changes in global surface temperature and changes in
rainfall patterns that in turn will pose a serious threat to plant vegetation
worldwide. As a result, understanding how plants will survive in a changing
climate will be increasingly important. Such challenges require integrated
approaches to increase agricultural production and cope with environmental
threats. Proteomics can play a role in unraveling the underlying mechanisms for
food production to address the growing demand for food. In this review, the
current status of food crop proteomics is discussed, especially in regard to the 
Asia and Oceania regions. Furthermore, the future perspective in relation to
proteomic techniques for the important food crops is highlighted.

Effects of different soil amendments were investigated on methane (CH4) and
nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, global warming potential (GWP) and yield scaled
GWPs in paddy soils of Republic of Korea, Japan and Bangladesh. The experimental 
treatments were NPK only, NPK+fly ash, NPK+silicate slag, NPK+phosphogypsum(PG), 
NPK+blast furnace slag (BFS), NPK+revolving furnace slag (RFS), NPK+silicate slag
(50%)+RFS (50%), NPK+biochar, NPK+biochar+Azolla-cyanobacteria, NPK+silicate
slag+Azolla-cyanobacteria, NPK+phosphogypsum (PG)+Azolla-cyanobacteria. The
maximum decrease in cumulative seasonal CH4 emissions was recorded 29.7% and
32.6% with Azolla-cyanobacteria plus phospho-gypsum amendments in paddy soils of 
Japan and Bangladesh respectively, followed by 22.4% and 26.8% reduction with
silicate slag plus Azolla-cyanobacteria application. Biochar amendments in paddy 
soils of Japan and Bangladesh decreased seasonal cumulative N2O emissions by
31.8% and 20.0% respectively, followed by 26.3% and 25.0% reduction with biochar 
plus Azolla-cyanobacteria amendments. Although seasonal cumulative CH4 emissions 
were significantly increased by 9.5-14.0% with biochar amendments, however,
global warming potentials were decreased by 8.0-12.0% with cyanobacterial
inoculation plus biochar amendments. The maximum decrease in GWP was calculated
22.0-30.0% with Azolla-cyanobacteria plus silicate slag amendments. The evolution
of greenhouse gases per unit grain yield (yield scaled GWP) was highest in the
NPK treatment, which was decreased by 43-50% from the silicate slag and
phosphogypsum amendments along with Azolla-cyanobacteria inoculated rice planted 
soils. Conclusively, it is recommended to incorporate Azolla-cyanobacteria with
inorganic and organic amendments for reducing GWP and yield scaled GWP from the
rice planted paddy soils of temperate and subtropical countries.

Considering intensive agricultural management practices and environmental
conditions, the LandscapeDNDC model was applied for simulation of yields, N2O
emission and nitrate leaching from major upland crops and temperate deciduous
forest of the Haean catchment, South Korea. Fertilization rates were high (up to 
314 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) and resulted in simulated direct N2O emissions from
potato, radish, soybean and cabbage fields of 1.9 and 2.1 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) in
2009 and 2010, respectively. Nitrate leaching was identified as the dominant
pathway of N losses in the Haean catchment with mean annual rates of 112.2 and
125.4 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), causing threats to water quality and leading to
substantial indirect N2O emissions of 0.84 and 0.94 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) in 2009 
and 2010 as estimates by applying the IPCC EF5. Simulated N2O emissions from
temperate deciduous forest were low (approx. 0.50 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) and
predicted nitrate leaching rates were even negligible (≤0.01 kg N ha(-1)
year(-1)). On catchment scale more than 50% of the total N2O emissions and up to 
75% of nitrate leaching originated from fertilized upland fields, only covering
24% of the catchment area. Taking into account area coverage of simulated upland 
crops and other land uses these numbers agree well with nitrate loads calculated 
from discharge and concentration measurements at the catchment outlet. The change
of current agricultural management practices showed a high potential of reducing 
N2O emission and nitrate leaching while maintaining current crop yields. Reducing
(39%) and splitting N fertilizer application into 3 times was most effective and 
lead to about 54% and 77% reducing of N2O emission and nitrate leaching from the 
Haean catchment, the latter potentially contributing to improved water quality in
the Soyang River Dam, which is the major source of drinking water for
metropolitan residents.

Comment in
    Lancet. 2015 Jul 25;386(9991):320-2.

BACKGROUND: Although studies have provided estimates of premature deaths
attributable to either heat or cold in selected countries, none has so far
offered a systematic assessment across the whole temperature range in populations
exposed to different climates. We aimed to quantify the total mortality burden
attributable to non-optimum ambient temperature, and the relative contributions
from heat and cold and from moderate and extreme temperatures.
METHODS: We collected data for 384 locations in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China,
Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, UK, and USA. We
fitted a standard time-series Poisson model for each location, controlling for
trends and day of the week. We estimated temperature-mortality associations with 
a distributed lag non-linear model with 21 days of lag, and then pooled them in a
multivariate metaregression that included country indicators and temperature
average and range. We calculated attributable deaths for heat and cold, defined
as temperatures above and below the optimum temperature, which corresponded to
the point of minimum mortality, and for moderate and extreme temperatures,
defined using cutoffs at the 2·5th and 97·5th temperature percentiles.
FINDINGS: We analysed 74,225,200 deaths in various periods between 1985 and 2012.
In total, 7·71% (95% empirical CI 7·43-7·91) of mortality was attributable to
non-optimum temperature in the selected countries within the study period, with
substantial differences between countries, ranging from 3·37% (3·06 to 3·63) in
Thailand to 11·00% (9·29 to 12·47) in China. The temperature percentile of
minimum mortality varied from roughly the 60th percentile in tropical areas to
about the 80-90th percentile in temperate regions. More temperature-attributable 
deaths were caused by cold (7·29%, 7·02-7·49) than by heat (0·42%, 0·39-0·44).
Extreme cold and hot temperatures were responsible for 0·86% (0·84-0·87) of total
mortality.
INTERPRETATION: Most of the temperature-related mortality burden was attributable
to the contribution of cold. The effect of days of extreme temperature was
substantially less than that attributable to milder but non-optimum weather. This
evidence has important implications for the planning of public-health
interventions to minimise the health consequences of adverse temperatures, and
for predictions of future effect in climate-change scenarios.

Climate change and mitigation measures have three major impacts on food
consumption and the risk of hunger: (1) changes in crop yields caused by climate 
change; (2) competition for land between food crops and energy crops driven by
the use of bioenergy; and (3) costs associated with mitigation measures taken to 
meet an emissions reduction target that keeps the global average temperature
increase to 2 °C. In this study, we combined a global computable general
equilibrium model and a crop model (M-GAEZ), and we quantified the three impacts 
on risk of hunger through 2050 based on the uncertainty range associated with 12 
climate models and one economic and demographic scenario. The strong mitigation
measures aimed at attaining the 2 °C target reduce the negative effects of
climate change on yields but have large negative impacts on the risk of hunger
due to mitigation costs in the low-income countries. We also found that in a
strongly carbon-constrained world, the change in food consumption resulting from 
mitigation measures depends more strongly on the change in incomes than the
change in food prices.

Striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) is a commercially important
freshwater fish used in inland aquaculture in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. The
culture industry is facing a significant challenge however from saltwater
intrusion into many low topographical coastal provinces across the Mekong Delta
as a result of predicted climate change impacts. Developing genomic resources for
this species can facilitate the production of improved culture lines that can
withstand raised salinity conditions, and so we have applied high-throughput Ion 
Torrent sequencing of transcriptome libraries from six target osmoregulatory
organs from striped catfish as a genomic resource for use in future selection
strategies. We obtained 12,177,770 reads after trimming and processing with an
average length of 97bp. De novo assemblies were generated using CLC Genomic
Workbench, Trinity and Velvet/Oases with the best overall contig performance
resulting from the CLC assembly. De novo assembly using CLC yielded 66,451
contigs with an average length of 478bp and N50 length of 506bp. A total of
37,969 contigs (57%) possessed significant similarity with proteins in the
non-redundant database. Comparative analyses revealed that a significant number
of contigs matched sequences reported in other teleost fishes, ranging in
similarity from 45.2% with Atlantic cod to 52% with zebrafish. In addition,
28,879 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 55,721 single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) were detected in the striped catfish transcriptome. The sequence
collection generated in the current study represents the most comprehensive
genomic resource for P. hypophthalmus available to date. Our results illustrate
the utility of next-generation sequencing as an efficient tool for constructing a
large genomic database for marker development in non-model species.

Climate change could shift the phenology of insects and plants and alter their
linkage in space and time. We examined the synchrony of rice and its insect pest,
Scotinophara lurida (Burmeister), under the representative concentration pathways
(RCP) 8.5 climate change scenario by comparing the mean spring immigration time
of overwintered S. lurida with the mean rice transplanting times in Korea. The
immigration time of S. lurida was estimated using an overwintered adult flight
model. The rice transplanting time of three cultivars (early, medium, and
medium-late maturing) was estimated by forecasting the optimal cultivation period
using leaf appearance and final leaf number models. A temperature increase
significantly advanced the 99% immigration time of S. lurida from Julian day
192.1 in the 2000s to 178.4 in the 2050s and 163.1 in the 2090s. In contrast,
rice transplanting time was significantly delayed in the early-maturing cultivar 
from day 141.2 in the 2000s to 166.7 in the 2050s and 190.6 in the 2090s, in the 
medium-maturing cultivar from day 130.6 in the 2000s to 156.6 in the 2050s and
184.7 in the 2090s, and in the medium-late maturing cultivar from day 128.5 in
2000s to 152.9 in the 2050s and 182.3 in the 2090s. These simulation results
predict a significant future phenological asynchrony between S. lurida and rice
in Korea.

Carbonaceous species (organic carbon [OC] and elemental carbon [EC]) and
inorganic ions of particulate matter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) were measured to
investigate the chemical characteristics of long-range-transported (LTP) PM2.5 at
Gosan, Jeju Island, in Korea in the spring and fall of 2008-2012 (excluding
2010). On average, the non-sea-salt (nss) sulfate (4.2 µg/m3) was the most
dominant species in the spring, followed by OC (2.6 µg/m3), nitrate (2.1 µg/m3), 
ammonium (1.7 µg/m3), and EC (0.6 µg/m3). In the fall, the nss-sulfate (4.7
µg/m3) was also the most dominant species, followed by OC (4.0 µg/m3), ammonium
(1.7 µg/m3), nitrate (1.1 µg/m3), and EC (0.7 µg/m3). Both sulfate and OC were
higher in the fall than in the spring, possibly due to more common northwest air 
masses (i.e., coming from China and Korea polluted areas) and more frequent
biomass burnings in the fall. There was no clear difference in the EC between the
spring and fall. The correlation between OC and EC was not strong; thus, the OC
measured at Gosan was likely transported across a long distance and was not
necessarily produced in a manner similar to the EC. Distinct types of LTP events 
(i.e., sulfate-dominant LTP versus OC-dominant LTP) were observed. In the
sulfate-dominant LTP events, air masses directly arrived at Gosan without passing
over the Korean Peninsula from the industrial area of China within 48 hr. During 
these events, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) increased to 1.63. Ionic balance
data suggest that the long-range transported aerosols are acidic. In the
OC-dominant LTP event, a higher residence time of air masses in Korea was
observed (the air masses departing from the mainland of China arrived at the
sampling site after passing Korea within 60-80 hr).IMPLICATIONS: In Northeast
Asia, various natural and anthropogenic sources contribute to the complex
chemical components and affect local/regional air quality and climate change.
Chemical characteristics of long-range-transported (LTP) PM2.5 were investigated 
during spring and fall of 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012. Based on air mass types,
sulfate-dominant LTP and OC-dominant LTP were observed. A long-term variation and
chemical characteristics of PM2.5 along with air mass and satellite data are
required to better understand long-range-transported aerosols.

This study investigates the relationship between violent conflict, food price,
and climate variability at the subnational level. Using disaggregated data on 113
African markets from January 1997 to April 2010, interrelationships between the
three variables are analyzed in simultaneous equation models. We find that: (i) a
positive feedback exists between food price and violence - higher food prices
increase conflict rates within markets and conflict increases food prices; (ii)
anomalously dry conditions are associated with increased frequencies of conflict;
and (iii) decreased rainfall exerts an indirect effect on conflict through its
impact on food prices. These findings suggest that the negative effects of
climate variability on conflict can be mitigated by interventions and effective
price management in local markets. Creating environments in which food prices are
stable and reliable, and markets are accessible and safe, can lower the impacts
of both climate change and conflict feedbacks.

We infer global and regional emissions of five of the most abundant
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) using atmospheric measurements from the Advanced Global
Atmospheric Gases Experiment and the National Institute for Environmental
Studies, Japan, networks. We find that the total CO2-equivalent emissions of the 
five HFCs from countries that are required to provide detailed, annual reports to
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) increased from
198 (175-221) Tg-CO2-eq ⋅ y(-1) in 2007 to 275 (246-304) Tg-CO2-eq ⋅ y(-1) in
2012. These global warming potential-weighted aggregated emissions agree well
with those reported to the UNFCCC throughout this period and indicate that the
gap between reported emissions and global HFC emissions derived from atmospheric 
trends is almost entirely due to emissions from nonreporting countries. However, 
our measurement-based estimates of individual HFC species suggest that emissions,
from reporting countries, of the most abundant HFC, HFC-134a, were only 79%
(63-95%) of the UNFCCC inventory total, while other HFC emissions were
significantly greater than the reported values. These results suggest that there 
are inaccuracies in the reporting methods for individual HFCs, which appear to
cancel when aggregated together.

Phytoplankton have attracted increasing attention in climate science due to their
impacts on climate systems. A new generation of climate models can now provide
estimates of future climate change, considering the biological feedbacks through 
the development of the coupled physical-ecosystem model. Here we present the
geophysical impact of phytoplankton, which is often overlooked in future climate 
projections. A suite of future warming experiments using a fully coupled
ocean-atmosphere model that interacts with a marine ecosystem model reveals that 
the future phytoplankton change influenced by greenhouse warming can amplify
Arctic surface warming considerably. The warming-induced sea ice melting and the 
corresponding increase in shortwave radiation penetrating into the ocean both
result in a longer phytoplankton growing season in the Arctic. In turn, the
increase in Arctic phytoplankton warms the ocean surface layer through direct
biological heating, triggering additional positive feedbacks in the Arctic, and
consequently intensifying the Arctic warming further. Our results establish the
presence of marine phytoplankton as an important potential driver of the future
Arctic climate changes.

Global energy demand is increasing rapidly and due to intensive consumption of
different forms of fuels, there are increasing concerns over the reduction in
readily available conventional energy resources. Because of the deleterious
atmospheric effects of fossil fuels and the uncertainties of future energy
supplies, there is a surge of interest to find environmentally friendly
alternative energy sources. Hydrogen (H2) has attracted worldwide attention as a 
secondary energy carrier, since it is the lightest carbon-neutral fuel rich in
energy per unit mass and easy to store. Several methods and technologies have
been developed for H2 production, but none of them are able to replace the
traditional combustion fuel used in automobiles so far. Extensively modified and 
renovated methods and technologies are required to introduce H2 as an alternative
efficient, clean, and cost-effective future fuel. Among several emerging
renewable energy technologies, photobiological H2 production by oxygenic
photosynthetic microbes such as green algae and cyanobacteria or by artificial
photosynthesis has attracted significant interest. In this short review, we
summarize the recent progress and challenges in H2-based energy production by
means of biological and artificial photosynthesis routes.

BACKGROUND: Climate change is affecting rice production in many countries.
Developing new rice varieties with heat tolerance is an essential way to sustain 
rice production in future global warming. We have previously reported four
quantitative trait loci (QTLs) responsible for rice spikelet fertility under high
temperature at flowering stage from an IR64/N22 population. To further explore
additional QTL from other varieties, two bi-parental F2 populations and one
three-way F2 population derived from heat tolerant variety Giza178 were used for 
indentifying and confirming QTLs for heat tolerance at flowering stage.
RESULTS: Four QTLs (qHTSF1.2, qHTSF2.1, qHTSF3.1 and qHTSF4.1) were identified in
the IR64/Giza178 population, and two other QTLs (qHTSF6.1 and qHTSF11.2) were
identified in the Milyang23/Giza178 population. To confirm the identified QTLs,
another three-way-cross population derived from IR64//Milyang23/Giza178 was
genotyped using 6K SNP chips. Five QTLs were identified in the three-way-cross
population, and three of those QTLs (qHTSF1.2, qHTSF4.1 and qHTSF6.1) were
overlapped with the QTLs identified in the bi-parental populations. The tolerance
alleles of these QTLs were from the tolerant parent Giza178 except for qHTSF3.1. 
The QTL on chromosome 4 (qHTSF4.1) is the same QTL previously identified in the
IR64/N22 population.
CONCLUSION: The results from different populations suggest that heat tolerance in
rice at flowering stage is controlled by several QTLs with small effects and
stronger heat tolerance could be attained through pyramiding validated heat
tolerance QTLs. QTL qHTSF4.1 was consistently detected across different genetic
backgrounds and could be an important source for enhancing heat tolerance in rice
at flowering stage. Polymorphic SNP markers in these QTL regions can be used for 
future fine mapping and developing SNP chips for marker-assisted breeding.

BACKGROUND: The health impacts of climate change are an issue of growing concern 
in the Pacific region. Prior to 2010, no formal, structured, evidence-based
approach had been used to identify the most significant health risks posed by
climate change in Pacific island countries. During 2010 and 2011, the World
Health Organization supported the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) in
performing a climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessment.
This paper summarizes the priority climate-sensitive health risks in FSM, with a 
focus on diarrheal disease, its link with climatic variables and the implications
of climate change.
METHODS: The vulnerability and adaptation assessment process included a review of
the literature, extensive stakeholder consultations, ranking of climate-sensitive
health risks, and analysis of the available long-term data on climate and
climate-sensitive infectious diseases in FSM, which involved examination of
health information data from the four state hospitals in FSM between 2000 and
2010; along with each state's rainfall, temperature and El Niño-Southern
Oscillation data. Generalized linear Poisson regression models were used to
demonstrate associations between monthly climate variables and cases of
climate-sensitive diseases at differing temporal lags.
RESULTS: Infectious diseases were among the highest priority climate-sensitive
health risks identified in FSM, particularly diarrheal diseases, vector-borne
diseases and leptospirosis. Correlation with climate data demonstrated
significant associations between monthly maximum temperature and monthly
outpatient cases of diarrheal disease in Pohnpei and Kosrae at a lag of one month
and 0 to 3 months, respectively; no such associations were observed in Chuuk or
Yap. Significant correlations between disease incidence and El Niño-Southern
Oscillation cycles were demonstrated in Kosrae state.
CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the available data demonstrated significant associations
between climate variables and climate-sensitive infectious diseases. This
information should prove useful in implementing health system and community
adaptation strategies to avoid the most serious impacts of climate change on
health in FSM.

Given the diminished role of biotic interactions in soils of continental
Antarctica, abiotic factors are believed to play a dominant role in structuring
of microbial communities. However, many ice-free regions remain unexplored, and
it is unclear which environmental gradients are primarily responsible for the
variations among bacterial communities. In this study, we investigated the soil
bacterial community around Terra Nova Bay of Victoria Land by pyrosequencing and 
determined which environmental variables govern the bacterial community structure
at the local scale. Six bacterial phyla, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria,
Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, were dominant, but 
their relative abundance varied greatly across locations. Bacterial community
structures were affected little by spatial distance, but structured more strongly
by site, which was in accordance with the soil physicochemical compositions. At
both the phylum and species levels, bacterial community structure was explained
primarily by pH and water content, while certain earth elements and trace metals 
also played important roles in shaping community variation. The higher
heterogeneity of the bacterial community structure found at this site indicates
how soil bacterial communities have adapted to different compositions of edaphic 
variables under extreme environmental conditions. Taken together, these findings 
greatly advance our understanding of the adaption of soil bacterial populations
to this harsh environment.

Both water quantity and quality are impacted by climate change. In addition,
rapid urbanization has also brought an immeasurable loss of life and property
resulting from floods. Hence, there is a need to predict changes in rainfall
events to effectively design stormwater infrastructure to protect urban areas
from disaster. This study develops a framework for predicting future short
duration rainfall intensity and examining the effects of climate change on urban 
runoff in the Gunja Drainage Basin. Non-stationarities in rainfall records are
first analysed using trend analysis to extrapolate future climate change
scenarios. The US Environmental Protection Agency Storm Water Management Model
(SWMM) was used for single event simulation of runoff quantity from the study
area. For the 1-hour and 24-hour durations, statistically significant upward
trends were observed. Although the 10-minute duration was only nearly significant
at the 90% level, the steepest slope was observed for this short duration.
Moreover, it was observed that the simulated peak discharge from SWMM increases
as the short duration rainfall intensity increases. The proposed framework is
thought to provide a means to review the current design of stormwater
infrastructures to determine their capacity, along with consideration of climate 
change impact.

BACKGROUND: Climate change may significantly affect human health. The possible
effects of high ambient temperature must be better understood, particularly in
terms of certain diseases' sensitivity to heat (as reflected in relative risks
[RR]) and the consequent disease burden (number or fraction of cases attributable
to high temperatures), in order to manage the threat.
PURPOSE: This study investigated the number of deaths attributable to abnormally 
high ambient temperatures in Seoul, South Korea, for a wide range of diseases.
METHOD: The relationship between mortality and daily maximum temperature using a 
generalized linear model was analyzed. The threshold temperature was defined as
the 90th percentile of maximum daily temperatures. Deaths were classified
according to ICD-10 codes, and for each disease, the RR and attributable
fractions were determined. Using these fractions, the total number of deaths
attributable to daily maximum temperatures above the threshold value, from 1992
to 2009, was calculated. Data analyses were conducted in 2012-2013.
RESULTS: Heat-attributable deaths accounted for 3,177 of the 271,633 deaths from 
all causes. Neurological (RR 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04-1.11) and mental and behavioral
disorders (RR 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07) had relatively high increases in the RR of
mortality. The most heat-sensitive diseases (those with the highest RRs) were not
the diseases that caused the largest number of deaths attributable to high
temperatures.
CONCLUSION: This study estimated RRs and deaths attributable to high ambient
temperature for a wide variety of diseases. Prevention-related policies must
account for both particular vulnerabilities (heat-sensitive diseases with high
RRs) and the major causes of the heat mortality burden (common conditions less
sensitive to high temperatures).

To address the impacts of past climate changes, particularly since the last
glacial period, on the history of the distribution and demography of marine
species, we investigated the evolutionary and demographic responses of the
intertidal batillariid gastropod, Batillaria attramentaria, to these changes,
using the snail as a model species in the northwest Pacific. We applied
phylogeographic and divergence population genetic approaches to mitochondrial COI
sequences from B. attramentaria. To cover much of its distributional range, 197
individuals collected throughout Korea and 507 publically available sequences
(mostly from Japan) were used. Finally, a Bayesian skyline plot (BSP) method was 
applied to reconstruct the demographic history of this species. We found four
differentiated geographic groups around Korea, confirming the presence of two
distinct, geographically subdivided haplogroups on the Japanese coastlines along 
the bifurcated routes of the warm Tsushima and Kuroshio Currents. These two
haplogroups were estimated to have begun to split approximately 400,000 years
ago. Population divergence analysis supported the hypothesis that the Yellow Sea 
was populated by a northward range expansion of a small fraction of founders that
split from a southern ancestral population since the last glacial maximum (LGM:
26,000-19,000 years ago), when the southern area became re-submerged. BSP
analyses on six geographically and genetically defined groups in Korea and Japan 
consistently demonstrated that each group has exponentially increased
approximately since the LGM. This study resolved the phylogeography of
B. attramentaria as a series of events connected over space and time; while
paleoceanographic conditions determining the connectivity of neighboring seas in 
East Asia are responsible for the vicariance of this species, the postglacial
sea-level rise and warming temperatures have played a crucial role in rapid range
shifts and broad demographic expansions of its populations.

In this article, we report the preparation, characterization and microalgae
recovery potential of a new family of fouling-resistant polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) ultrafiltration (UF) membranes embedded with hydrophilic and PEGylated
polymeric particles. To optimize membrane performance for microalgae harvesting, 
we investigate the effects of three hydrophilic additives (Pluronic F-127,
polyvinylpyrrolidone and polyethylene glycol) on the morphology, pore size, bulk 
composition, surface composition, wettability and surface charge, flux and
fouling resistance of the mixed matrix PVDF membranes with in situ PEGylated
polyethyleneimine (PEI) particles. Our filtration experiments show that a mixed
matrix PVDF membrane with PEGylated PEI particles and Pluronic F-127 additive
(PNSM-1) has an algae retention of 100% with a permeate flux of 96 L/m(2)/hr that
is larger (by ∼50%) than that of a commercial and hydrophilic PVDF UF membrane
with a molecular weight cut-off of 30 kDa using a suspension of Chlorella sp.
KR-1 microalgae with 1.2-1.4 g/L of dry biomass. The algae and water flux
recovery rates of our new PNSM-1 are equal to∼ 94% and 100%, respectively,
following a simulated membrane wash with deionized water and two subsequent water
and microalgae filtration cycles.

The increase of atmospheric greenhouse gases such as CO2 has caused noticeable
climate change. Since increased CO2 may contribute to carbon storage in
terrestrial ecosystems through the CO2 cycle between the atmosphere and
vegetation, it is necessary to improve methods for measuring C in soil. In this
study, we determined the total carbon concentrations of soils using a highly
sensitive and rapid method, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy. The presence of
C has been measured by detecting signal at the wavelength of 247.86 nm. The
obstacle of Fe interference at the C measurement wavelength of 247.86 nm was
reduced by selecting the optimal delay time of 1.4 μs. The ratio of peak
intensities (areas) at 247.86 nm for C and 248.20 nm for Fe was then successfully
applied to the calibration curve. In addition, to dismiss the problem of
measuring the C lines at 247.86 nm, 193.03 nm has been used to observe C
emission. Both the 193.03- and 247.86-nm lines provided significant linear
calibrations. The 193.03-nm lines presented stronger relative accuracies in
predicting the lower C concentrations of the unknown samples than that one at
247.86 nm.

Impact of elevated CO₂ and N addition on bacteria, fungi, and archaea in a marsh 
ecosystem with various types of plants.

The individual effects of either elevated CO2 or N deposition on soil microbial
communities have been widely studied, but limited information is available
regarding the responses of the bacteria, fungi, and archaea communities to both
elevated CO2 and N in wetland ecosystems with different types of plants. Using a 
terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and real-time
quantitative PCR (RT-Q-PCR), we compared communities of bacteria, fungi, and
archaea in a marsh microcosm with one of seven macrophytes, Typha latifolia,
Phragmites japonica, Miscanthus sacchariflorus, Scirpus lacustris, Juncus
effusus, Phragmites australis, or Zizania latifolia, after exposing them to eCO2 
and/or amended N for 110 days. Overall, our results showed that the elevated CO2 
and N may affect the bacterial and archaeal communities, while they may not
affect the fungal community in terms of both diversity and abundance. The effects
of elevated CO2 and N on microbial community vary depending on the plant types,
and each microbial community shows different responses to the elevated CO2 and N.
In particular, elevated CO2 might force a shift in the archaeal community
irrespective of the plant type, and the effect of elevated CO2 was enhanced when 
combined with the N effect. This study indicates that elevated CO2 and N addition
could lead to changes in the community structures of bacteria and archaea. Our
results also suggest that the fungal group is less sensitive to external changes,
while the bacterial and archaeal groups are more sensitive to them. Finally, the 
characteristics of the plant type and relevant physicochemical factors induced by
the elevated CO2 and N may be important key factors structuring the microbial
community's response to environmental change, which implies the need for a more
comprehensive approach to understanding the pattern of the wetland response to
climate change.

Anthropogenic climate change is linked to food web and salinity fluctuations in
estuarine environments. Both decreased nutritional status and environmental
salinity influence the physiological tolerance and health of fish populations;
however, limited information on the interaction of these two factors and their
physiological consequences is available. The green sturgeon (Acipenser
medirostris) is a species of special concern in California, and the southern
distinct population segment is listed as threatened. To test the hypothesis that 
poor nutrition negatively affects osmoregulation, juvenile green sturgeon (222 d 
posthatch) were randomly assigned to four feed restriction groups (12.5%, 25%,
50%, and 100% of the optimal feeding rate for 4 wk). Fish were then acutely
exposed to 0-, 8-, 16-, or 32-ppt salinities and sampled at three time points
(12, 72, or 120 h). Feed restriction significantly (P < 0.05) decreased specific 
growth rate, feed efficiency, condition factor, whole-body lipids, and protein
content as well as plasma glucose, triglycerides, and proteins. Furthermore, feed
restriction, salinity concentration, and salinity exposure time had significant
effects on hematological indexes (hematocrit, hemoglobin), plasma values
(osmolality, Na(+), K(+), Cl(-), glucose, lactate, cortisol), enzymatic activity 
(gill and pyloric ceca Na(+)/K(+) ATPase), and morphology of gill
mitochondria-rich cells. The largest disturbances were observed at the highest
salinity treatments across all feeding regimes. In addition, the interaction
between feed restriction and acute salinity exposure at the highest salinity
treatment resulted in high mortality rates during the first 72 h of salinity
exposure. Evaluating the interactions of these environmental stressors and their 
implications on green sturgeon physiological tolerance will inform restoration
and management efforts in rapidly changing estuarine environments.

This study developed three scenarios of future land use/land cover on a local
level for the Kyung-An River Basin and its vicinity in South Korea at a 30-m
resolution based on the two scenario families of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report Emissions Scenarios (SRES): A2 and B1, as
well as a business-as-usual scenario. The IPCC SRES A2 and B1 were used to define
future local development patterns and associated land use change. We quantified
the population-driven demand for urban land use for each qualitative storyline
and allocated the urban demand in geographic space using the SLEUTH model. The
model results demonstrate the possible land use/land cover change scenarios for
the years from 2000 to 2070 by examining the broad narrative of each SRES within 
the context of a local setting, such as the Kyoungan River Basin, constructing
narratives of local development shifts and modeling a set of 'best guess'
approximations of the future land use conditions in the study area. This study
found substantial differences in demands and patterns of land use changes among
the scenarios, indicating compact development patterns under the SRES B1 compared
to the rapid and dispersed development under the SRES A2.

•PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The paleogeographical origin of the relict North American 
Sequoia sempervirens is controversial. Fossil records indicate a Neogene origin
for its foliage characteristics. Although several fossils from the Miocene
sediments in eastern Asia have been considered to have close affinities with the 
modern S. sempervirens, they lack the typical features of a leafy twig bearing
linear as well as scale leaves, and the fertile shoots terminating by a cone. The
taxonomic status of these fossils has remained unclear.•
METHODS: New better-preserved fossils from the upper Miocene of China indicate a 
new species of Sequoia. This finding not only confirms the former presence of
this genus in eastern Asia, but it also confirms the affinity of this Asian form 
to the modern relict S. sempervirens.•
KEY RESULTS: The principal foliage characteristics of S. sempervirens had already
originated by the late Miocene. The eastern Asian records probably imply a
Beringian biogeographic track of the ancestor of S. sempervirens in the early
Neogene, at a time when the land bridge was not too cool for this thermophilic
conifer to spread between Asia and North America.•
CONCLUSIONS: The climatic context of the new fossil Sequoia in Southeast Yunnan, 
based on other floristic elements of the fossil assemblage in which it is found, 
is presumed to be warm and humid. Following the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, this warm, humid climate was replaced by the present monsoonal climate
with dry winter and spring. This change may have led to the disappearance of this
hygrophilous conifer from eastern Asia.

Current progress towards the metabolic engineering of plant seed oil for hydroxy 
fatty acids production.

Science, Rural Development Administration, Jeonju, 560-500, Republic of Korea.

KEY MESSAGE: Hydroxy fatty acids produced in plant seed oil are important
industrial material. This review focuses on the use of metabolic engineering
approaches for the production of hydroxy fatty acids in transgenic plants.
Vegetable oil is not only edible but can also be used for industrial purposes.
The industrial demand for vegetable oil will increase with the continued
depletion of fossil fuels and ensuing environmental issues such as climate
change, caused by increased carbon dioxide in the air. Some plants accumulate
high levels of unusual fatty acids in their seeds, and these fatty acids (FAs)
have properties that make them suitable for industrial applications. Hydroxy
fatty acids (HFAs) are some of the most important of these industrial FAs. Castor
oil is the conventional source of HFA. However, due to the presence of toxin
ricin in its seeds, castor is not cultivated on a large scale. Lesquerella is
another HFA accumulator and is currently being developed as a new crop for a safe
source of HFAs. The mechanisms of HFA synthesis and accumulation have been
extensively studied using castor genes and the model plant Arabidopsis. HFAs
accumulated to 17% in the seed oil of Arabidopsis expressing a FA hydroxylase
gene from castor (RcFAH12), but its seed oil content and plant growth decreased. 
When RcFAH12 gene was coexpressed with additional castor gene(s) in Arabidopsis, 
~30% HFAs were accumulated and the seed oil content and plant growth was almost
restored to the wild-type level. Further advancement of our understanding of
pathways, genes and regulatory mechanisms underlying synthesis and accumulation
of HFAs is essential to developing and implementing effective genetic approaches 
for enhancing HFA production in oilseeds.

Due to the growing concerns on the climate change and sustainability on
petrochemical resources, DOE selected and announced the bio-based top 12 building
blocks and discussed the needs for developing biorefinery technologies to replace
the current petroleum based industry in 2004. Over the last 10 years after its
announcement, many studies have been performed for the development of efficient
technologies for the bio-based production of these chemicals and derivatives.
Now, ten chemicals among these top 12 chemicals, excluding the l-aspartic acid
and 3-hydroxybutyrolactone, have already been commercialized or are close to
commercialization. In this paper, we review the current status of biorefinery
development for the production of these platform chemicals and their derivatives.
In addition, current technological advances on industrial strain development for 
the production of platform chemicals using micro-organisms will be covered in
detail with case studies on succinic acid and 3-hydroxypropionic acid as
examples.

Climate changes and continuous population growth increase water demands that will
not be met by traditional water resources, like surface and ground water. To
handle increased water demand, treated municipal wastewater is offered to farmers
for agricultural irrigation. This study aimed to enhance the effluent quality
from worn-out sewage treatment facilities in rural villages, retreat effluent to 
meet water quality criteria for irrigation, and assess any health-related and
environmental impacts from using retreated wastewater irrigation on crops and in 
soil. We developed the compact wastewater retreatment and reuse system (WRRS),
equipped with filters, ultraviolet light, and bubble elements. A pilot greenhouse
experiment was conducted to evaluate lettuce growth patterns and quantify the
heavy metal concentration and pathogenic microorganisms on lettuce and in soil
after irrigating with tap water, treated wastewater, and WRRS retreated
wastewater. The purification performance of each WRRS component was also
assessed. The study findings revealed that existing worn-out sewage treatment
facilities in rural villages could meet the water quality criteria for treated
effluent and also reuse retreated wastewater for crop growth and other
miscellaneous agricultural purposes.

Korea, China, Japan and Canada are all members of the Montreal Process (MP).
However, there has been little comparative research on the public awareness of
forest values within the framework of Sustainable Forest Management, not only
between Asia and Canada, but also among these three Asian countries. This is true
of aesthetic values, especially as the MP framework has no indicator for
aesthetic values. We conducted surveys to identify similarities and differences
in the perceptions of various forest values, including aesthetic values, between 
residents of the four countries: university student groups in Korea, China, Japan
and Canada, as well as a more detailed assessment of the attitudes of Koreans by 
including two additional groups, Korean office workers, and Koreans living in
Canada. A multivariate analysis of variance test across the four university
student groups revealed significant differences in the rating of six forest
functions out of 31. However the same test across the three Korean groups
indicated no significant differences indicating higher confidence in the
generalizability of our university student comparisons. For the forest aesthetic 
values, an analysis of variance test showed no significant differences across all
groups. The forest aesthetic value was rated 6.95 to 7.98 (out of 10.0) depending
on the group and rated relatively highly among ten social values across all the
groups. Thurstone scale rankings and relative distances of six major forest
values indicated that climate change control was ranked as the highest priority
and scenic beauty was ranked the lowest by all the groups. Comparison tests of
the frequencies of preferred major forest values revealed no significant
differences across the groups with the exception of the Japanese group. These
results suggest that public awareness of aesthetic and other forest values are
not clearly correlated with the cultural backgrounds of the individuals, and the 
Korean university students' awareness could potentially be representative of the 
Koreans general public's opinion. We expect this research to contribute to the
development of aesthetic and social indicators, and to the enhancement of
balancing social with environmental and economic values within the SFM framework.

Most plant viruses counter the RNA silencing-based antiviral defense by
expressing viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs). In this sense, VSRs may be 
regarded as virulence effectors that can be recognized by the host as avirulence 
(avr) factors to induce R-mediated resistance. We made use of
Agrobacterium-mediated transient coexpression of VSRs in combination with Potato 
virus X (PVX) to recapitulate in local tissues the systemic necrosis (SN) caused 
by PVX-potyvirus synergistic infections in Nicotiana benthamiana. The
hypersensitive response (HR)-like response was associated with an enhanced
accumulation of PVX subgenomic RNAs. We further show that expression of P25, the 
VSR of PVX, in the presence of VSR from different viruses elicited an HR-like
response in Nicotiana spp. Furthermore, the expression of P25 by a Plum pox virus
(PPV) vector was sufficient to induce an increase of PPV pathogenicity that led
to necrotic mottling. A frameshift mutation in the P25 open reading frame (ORF)
of PVX did not lead to necrosis when coexpressed with VSRs. These findings
indicate that P25 is the main PVX determinant involved in eliciting a systemic
HR-like response in PVX-associated synergisms. Moreover, we show that silencing
of SGT1 and RAR1 attenuated cell death in both PVX-potyvirus synergistic
infection and the HR-like response elicited by P25. Our study underscores that
P25 variants that have impaired ability to suppress RNA silencing cannot act as
elicitors when synergized by the presence of other VSRs. These findings highlight
the importance of RNA silencing suppression activity in the HR-like response
elicited by VSRs in certain hosts.IMPORTANCE: The work presented here describes
how the activity of the PVX suppressor P25 elicits an HR-like response in
Nicotiana spp. when overexpressed with other VSR proteins. This finding suggests 
that the SN response caused by PVX-associated synergisms is a delayed immune
response triggered by P25, once it reaches a threshold level by the action of
other VSRs. Moreover, this work supports the contention that the silencing
suppressor activity of PVX P25 protein is a prerequisite for HR elicitation. We
propose that unidentified avr determinants could be involved in other cases of
viral synergisms in which heterologous "helper" viruses encoding strong VSRs
exacerbate the accumulation of the avr-encoding virus.

The warm-temperate regions of the globe characterized by dry summers and wet
winters (Mediterranean climate; MED) are especially vulnerable to climate change.
The potential impact on water resources, ecosystems and human livelihood requires
a detailed picture of the future changes in this unique climate zone. Here we
apply a probabilistic approach to quantitatively address how and why the
geographic distribution of MED will change based on the latest-available climate 
projections for the 21st century. Our analysis provides, for the first time, a
robust assessment of significant northward and eastward future expansions of MED 
over both the Euro-Mediterranean and western North America. Concurrently, we show
a significant 21st century replacement of the equatorward MED margins by the arid
climate type. Moreover, future winters will become wetter and summers drier in
both the old and newly established MED zones. Should these projections be
realized, living conditions in some of the most densely populated regions in the 
world will be seriously jeopardized.

Biofuels have been attracting increasing attention to provide a solution to the
problems of climate change and our dependence on limited fossil oil. During the
last decade, metabolic engineering has been performed to develop superior
microorganisms for the production of so called advanced biofuels. Among the
advanced biofuels, hydrocarbons possess high-energy content and superior fuel
properties to other biofuels, and thus have recently been attracting much
research interest. Here we review the recent advances in the microbial production
of hydrocarbon fuels together with the metabolic engineering strategies employed 
to develop their production strains. Strategies employed for the production of
long-chain and short-chain hydrocarbons derived from fatty acid metabolism along 
with the isoprenoid-derived hydrocarbons are reviewed. Also, the current
limitations and future prospects in hydrocarbon-based biofuel production are
discussed.

To predict biotic responses to disturbances in forest environments, it is
important to examine both the thermophysical properties of forest soils and the
diversity of microorganisms that these soils contain. To predict the effects of
climate change on forests, in particular, it is essential to understand the
interactions between the soil surface, the air, and the biological diversity in
the soil. In this study, the temperature and thermal properties of forest soil at
three depths at a site in the Haean basin of Korea were measured over a period of
four months. Metagenomic analyses were also carried out to ascertain the
diversity of microorganisms inhabiting the soil. The thermal diffusivity of the
soil at the study site was 5.9 × 10(-8) m(2) · s(-1). The heat flow through the
soil resulted from the cooling and heating processes acting on the surface layers
of the soils. The heat productivity in the soil varied through time. The phylum
Proteobacteria predominated at all three soil depths, with members of
Proteobacteria forming a substantial fraction (25.64 to 39.29%). The diversity
and richness of microorganisms in the soil were both highest at the deepest
depth, 90 cm, where the soil temperature fluctuation was the minimum.

The recent increase in anthropogenic emissions of reactive nitrogen from
northeastern Asia and the subsequent enhanced deposition over the extensive
regions of the North Pacific Ocean (NPO) have led to a detectable increase in the
nitrate (N) concentration of the upper ocean. The rate of increase of excess N
relative to phosphate (P) was found to be highest (~0.24 micromoles per kilogram 
per year) in the vicinity of the Asian source continent, with rates decreasing
eastward across the NPO, consistent with the magnitude and distribution of
atmospheric nitrogen deposition. This anthropogenically driven increase in the N 
content of the upper NPO may enhance primary production in this N-limited region,
potentially leading to a long-term change of the NPO from being N-limited to
P-limited.

This study investigated the possible presence of the Bluetongue virus (BTV) in
the Republic of Korea (ROK). Cell cultures were used to test blood samples
collected from abattoirs throughout the country. Testing identified a single BTV 
isolate, which was characterized as BTV serotype 1 based on a nucleotide sequence
analysis of the segment 2 gene. This report therefore indicates that BTV serotype
1 is present in the ROK. The potential importance of BTV in the ROK has been
overlooked because cattle are mostly unaffected by the virus and because sheep,
the most severely infected hosts, are uncommon in the ROK. However, as recent BTV
serotype 8 outbreaks in Europe have demonstrated, certain BTV strains have the
potential to cause severe disease in cattle. Additionally, with climate change
continuously expanding the regions in which Culicoides vectors are able to
survive, there is an increased need to study BTV in the Far East and ROK. To
better prepare for future outbreaks of BTV, a sustained and effective level of
surveillance for BTV in livestock will need to be established.

Global climate and the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) are
correlated over recent glacial cycles. The combination of processes responsible
for a rise in atmospheric CO2 at the last glacial termination (23,000 to
9,000 years ago), however, remains uncertain. Establishing the timing and rate of
CO2 changes in the past provides critical insight into the mechanisms that
influence the carbon cycle and helps put present and future anthropogenic
emissions in context. Here we present CO2 and methane (CH4) records of the last
deglaciation from a new high-accumulation West Antarctic ice core with
unprecedented temporal resolution and precise chronology. We show that although
low-frequency CO2 variations parallel changes in Antarctic temperature, abrupt
CO2 changes occur that have a clear relationship with abrupt climate changes in
the Northern Hemisphere. A significant proportion of the direct radiative forcing
associated with the rise in atmospheric CO2 occurred in three sudden steps, each 
of 10 to 15 parts per million. Every step took place in less than two centuries
and was followed by no notable change in atmospheric CO2 for about 1,000 to
1,500 years. Slow, millennial-scale ventilation of Southern Ocean CO2-rich,
deep-ocean water masses is thought to have been fundamental to the rise in
atmospheric CO2 associated with the glacial termination, given the strong
covariance of CO2 levels and Antarctic temperatures. Our data establish a
contribution from an abrupt, centennial-scale mode of CO2 variability that is not
directly related to Antarctic temperature. We suggest that processes operating on
centennial timescales, probably involving the Atlantic meridional overturning
circulation, seem to be influencing global carbon-cycle dynamics and are at
present not widely considered in Earth system models.

Because of global warming, the quantity of naturally generated mercury (Hg) will 
increase, subsequently methylation of Hg existing in seawater may be enhanced,
and the content of metal in marine products rise which consequently results in
harm to human health. Studies of the effects of temperatures on Hg absorption
have not been adequate. In this study, in order to observe the effects of
temperature changes on Hg absorption, inorganic Hg or methylmercury (MeHg) was
added to water tanks containing loaches. Loach survival rates decreased with
rising temperatures, duration, and exposure concentrations in individuals exposed
to inorganic Hg and MeHg. The MeHg-treated group died sooner than the inorganic
Hg-exposed group. The total Hg and MeHg content significantly increased with
temperature and time in both metal-exposed groups. The MeHg-treated group had
higher metal absorption rates than inorganic Hg-treated loaches. The correlation 
coefficients for temperature elevation and absorption were significant in both
groups. The results of this study may be used as basic data for assessing in vivo
hazards from environmental changes such as climate warming.

Since its reappearance at the Military Demarcation Line in 1993, malaria has been
occurring annually in Korea. Malaria is regarded as a third grade nationally
notifiable disease susceptible to climate change. The objective of this study is 
to quantify the effect of climatic factors on the occurrence of malaria in Korea 
and construct a malaria occurrence model for predicting the future trend of
malaria under the influence of climate change. Using data from 2001-2011, the
effect of time lag between malaria occurrence and mean temperature, relative
humidity and total precipitation was investigated using spectral analysis. Also, 
a principal component regression model was constructed, considering
multicollinearity. Future climate data, generated from RCP 4.5 climate change
scenario and CNCM3 climate model, was applied to the constructed regression model
to simulate future malaria occurrence and analyze the trend of occurrence.
Results show an increase in the occurrence of malaria and the shortening of
annual time of occurrence in the future.

Electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to small organic fuels (e.g.
formate, methanol, ethylene, ethanol) is touted as one of the most promising
approaches for solving the problems of climate change and energy security. In
this study, we report the highly efficient electrochemical reduction of CO2 using
cuprous oxide (Cu2O) electrodes to produce ethylene (C2H4) primarily. During CO2 
electrolysis using electrodeposited Cu2O on a carbon electrode, we observe the
transformation of a compact metal oxide layer to a metal oxide structure with
oxygen vacant sites at the bulk region. In contrast to previous studies, our
results clearly indicate that Cu2O remains at the surface of the catalyst and it 
efficiently catalyzes the conversion process of CO2 at low overpotential,
exhibiting a high selective faradaic efficiency of over 20% towards C2H4
formation even in long-term electrolysis.

Temporal changes in soil bacterial diversity and humic substances degradation in 
subarctic tundra soil.

Humic substances (HS), primarily humic acids (HA) and fulvic acids (FA), are the 
largest constituent of soil organic matter. In microcosm systems with subarctic
HS-rich tundra soil (site AK 1-75; approximately 5.6 °C during the thawing
period) from Council, Alaska, the HA content significantly decreased to 48% after
a 99-day incubation at 5 °C as part of a biologically mediated process.
Accordingly, levels of FA, a putative byproduct of HA degradation, consistently
increased to 172% during an identical incubation process. Culture-independent
microbial community analysis showed that during the microcosm experiments, the
relative abundance of phyla Proteobacteria (bacteria) and Euryarchaeota (archaea)
largely increased, indicating their involvement in HS degradation. When the
indigenous bacteria in AK 1-75 were enriched in an artificial mineral medium
spiked with HA, the changes in relative abundance were most conspicuous in
Proteobacteria (from 60.2 to 79.0%), specifically Betaproteobacteria-related
bacteria. One hundred twenty-two HA-degrading bacterial strains, primarily from
the genera Paenibacillus (phylum Firmicutes) and Pseudomonas (class
Gammaproteobacteria), were cultivated from AK 1-75 and nearby sites. Through
culture-dependent analysis with these bacterial isolates, we observed increasing 
HS-degradation rates in parallel with rising temperatures in a range of 0 °C to
20 °C, with the most notable increase occurring at 8 °C compared to 6 °C. Our
results indicate that, although microbial-mediated HS degradation occurs at
temperature as low as 5 °C in tundra ecosystems, increasing soil temperature
caused by global climate change could enhance HS degradation rates. Extending the
thawing period could also increase degradation activity, thereby directly
affecting nearby microbial communities and rhizosphere environments.

BACKGROUND: There has been no population-based study on human papillomavirus
(HPV) prevalence or its genotypes in Bangladesh; a country eligible for GAVI
funding for HPV vaccine.
METHODS: We used baseline survey data of a prospective cohort study that was
conducted in one urban and one rural area of Bangladesh. A total of 997 urban and
905 rural married women, aged 13 to 64 years, were enrolled in the baseline
during July-December, 2011. Information was collected on socio-demographic
characteristics and potential risk factors for HPV infection followed by
gynecological examination and collection of endocervical samples using the
cervical cytobrush (Digene cervical sampler). HPV DNA testing was done by
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using a consensus primer set.
RESULTS: Prevalence of any HPV infection was 7.7% with no significant difference 
between urban and rural women. Most common high-risk genotypes were HPV16, HPV66,
HPV18, HPV45, HPV31 and HPV53. Urban women working as housemaids or garment
workers were at higher risk of any HPV infection (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.13-4.11)
compared to housewives. Rural women whose husband lived overseas were almost two 
times more likely to have any HPV infection (OR = 1.93; 95% CI 1.05-3.55)
compared to women whose husbands lived with them.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HPV infection among Bangladeshi women is similar to
other regions of Asia. However, type-specific patterns are different. The study
findings will inform the formulation of HPV vaccination policies in Bangladesh,
monitoring the impact of vaccination programmes, and the identification of target
populations for screening.

BACKGROUND: Extreme temperatures and temperature changes are known indicators of 
climate change, and large temperature variations for several consecutive days may
affect human health such as exacerbating respiratory symptoms. The objective of
this study was to determine the association between outdoor temperature change
and asthma-related emergency department visits. In particular, this study
examined seasonality and identified susceptible populations, such as the elderly.
METHODS: The health data for asthma-related emergency department visits were
collected from July 1, 2007, to December 31, 2010 in Seoul, Korea, through the
National Emergency Department Information System of the National Emergency
Medical Center and we defined temperature change as the absolute difference of
mean temperature between the current day and the previous day. We applied
generalized linear models with an allowance of over-dispersion for quantifying
the estimated effects of temperature change on asthma-related emergency
department visits, adjusting for meteorological conditions, air pollution, and
time trend.
RESULTS: In general, temperature change was adversely associated with
asthma-related emergency department visits, with a 1-unit increase of temperature
change associated with a 3.5% (95% CI 0.7, 6.4%) increase in emergency department
visits. In addition, seasonal variation after adjusting for mean temperature and 
diurnal temperature range had an adverse effect in spring, summer, and fall and a
protective effect in winter. Patients aged ≥65 years experienced the most
prominent effect during the fall, with a 17.9% (95% CI 4.1, 33.6%) increase in
emergency department visits per 1-unit increase of temperature change, whereas
the other seasons showed no statistically significant association.
CONCLUSIONS: Along with diurnal temperature range, temperature change may be an
alternative indicator of climate change. Temperature change variables are
well-known and easy to communicate with the public relative to the health effects
of outdoor temperature fluctuations.

During the last few decades, the prevalence of allergic disease has increased
dramatically. The development of allergic diseases has been attributed to complex
interactions between environmental factors and genetic factors. Of the many
possible environmental factors, most research has focused on the most commonly
encountered environmental factors, such as air pollution and environmental
microbiota in combination with climate change. There is increasing evidence that 
such environmental factors play a critical role in the regulation of the immune
response that is associated with allergic diseases, especially in genetically
susceptible individuals. This review deals with not only these environmental
factors and genetic factors but also their interactions in the development of
allergic diseases. It will also emphasize the need for early interventions that
can prevent the development of allergic diseases in susceptible populations and
how these interventions can be identified.

The impact of climate change has been significant enough to endanger human health
both directly and indirectly via heat stress, degraded air quality, rising sea
levels, food and water security, extreme weather events (e.g., floods, droughts, 
earthquakes, volcano eruptions, tsunamis, hurricanes, etc.), vulnerable shelter, 
and population migration. The deterioration of environmental conditions may
facilitate the transmission of diarrhea, vector-borne and infectious diseases,
cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses, malnutrition, etc. Indirect effects of 
climate change such as mental health problems due to stress, loss of homes,
economic instability, and forced migration are also unignorably important.
Children, the elderly, and communities living in poverty are among the most
vulnerable of the harmful effects due to climate change. In this article, we have
reviewed the scientific evidence for the human health impact of climate change
and analyzed the various diseases in association with changes in the atmospheric 
environment and climate conditions.

This study proposed a robust prioritization framework to identify the priorities 
of treated wastewater (TWW) use locations with consideration of various
uncertainties inherent in the climate change scenarios and the decision-making
process. First, a fuzzy concept was applied because future forecast precipitation
and their hydrological impact analysis results displayed significant variances
when considering various climate change scenarios and long periods (e.g.,
2010-2099). Second, various multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques
including weighted sum method (WSM), Technique for Order of Preference by
Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and fuzzy TOPSIS were introduced to robust 
prioritization because different MCDM methods use different decision
philosophies. Third, decision making method under complete uncertainty (DMCU)
including maximin, maximax, minimax regret, Hurwicz, and equal likelihood were
used to find robust final rankings. This framework is then applied to a Korean
urban watershed. As a result, different rankings were obviously appeared between 
fuzzy TOPSIS and non-fuzzy MCDMs (e.g., WSM and TOPSIS) because the inter-annual 
variability in effectiveness was considered only with fuzzy TOPSIS. Then, robust 
prioritizations were derived based on 18 rankings from nine decadal periods of
RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. For more robust rankings, five DMCU approaches using the
rankings from fuzzy TOPSIS were derived. This framework combining fuzzy TOPSIS
with DMCU approaches can be rendered less controversial among stakeholders under 
complete uncertainty of changing environments.

We present here a conceptual model and analysis of complex systems using
hypothetical cases of regime shifts resulting from temporal non-stationarity in
attractor strengths, and then present selected published cases to illustrate such
regime shifts in hydrologic systems (shallow aquatic ecosystems; water table
shifts; soil salinization). Complex systems are dynamic and can exist in two or
more stable states (or regimes). Temporal variations in state variables occur in 
response to fluctuations in external forcing, which are modulated by interactions
among internal processes. Combined effects of external forcing and non-stationary
strengths of alternative attractors can lead to shifts from original to alternate
regimes. In systems with bi-stable states, when the strengths of two competing
attractors are constant in time, or are non-stationary but change in a linear
fashion, regime shifts are found to be temporally stationary and only controlled 
by the characteristics of the external forcing. However, when attractor strengths
change in time non-linearly or vary stochastically, regime shifts in complex
systems are characterized by non-stationary probability density functions (pdfs).
We briefly discuss implications and challenges to prediction and management of
hydrologic complex systems.

Successive cold winters of severely low temperatures in recent years have had
critical social and economic impacts on the mid-latitude continents in the
Northern Hemisphere. Although these cold winters are thought to be partly driven 
by dramatic losses of Arctic sea-ice, the mechanism that links sea-ice loss to
cold winters remains a subject of debate. Here, by conducting observational
analyses and model experiments, we show how Arctic sea-ice loss and cold winters 
in extra-polar regions are dynamically connected through the polar stratosphere. 
We find that decreased sea-ice cover during early winter months
(November-December), especially over the Barents-Kara seas, enhances the upward
propagation of planetary-scale waves with wavenumbers of 1 and 2, subsequently
weakening the stratospheric polar vortex in mid-winter (January-February). The
weakened polar vortex preferentially induces a negative phase of Arctic
Oscillation at the surface, resulting in low temperatures in mid-latitudes.

Patterns of precipitation have changed as a result of climate change and will
potentially keep changing in the future. Therefore, it is critical to understand 
how ecosystem processes will respond to the variation of precipitation. However, 
compared to aboveground processes, the effects of precipitation change on soil
microorganisms remain poorly understood. Changbai Mountain is an ideal area to
study the responses of temperate forests to the variations in precipitation. In
this study, we conducted a manipulation experiment to simulation variation of
precipitation in the virgin, broad-leaved Korean pine mixed forest in Changbai
Mountain. Plots were designed to increase precipitation by 30 % [increased (+)]
or decrease precipitation by 30 % [decreased (-)]. We analyzed differences in the
diversity of the bacterial community in surface bulk soils (0-5 and 5-10 cm) and 
rhizosphere soils between precipitation treatments, including control. Bacteria
were identified using the high-throughput 454 sequencing method. We obtained a
total 271,496 optimized sequences, with a mean value of 33,242 (±1,412.39)
sequences for each soil sample. Being the same among the sample plots with
different precipitation levels, the dominant bacterial communities were
Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Chloroflexi.
Bacterial diversity and abundance declined with increasing soil depth. In the
bulk soil of 0-5 cm, the bacterial diversity and abundance was the highest in the
control plots and the lowest in plots with reduced precipitation. However, in the
soil of 5-10 cm, the diversity and abundance of bacteria was the highest in the
plots of increased precipitation and the lowest in the control plots. Bacterial
diversity and abundance in rhizosphere soils decreased with increased
precipitation. This result implies that variation in precipitation did not change
the composition of the dominant bacterial communities but affected bacterial
abundance and the response patterns of the dominant communities to variation in
precipitation.

BACKGROUND: Studies have examined the effects of temperature on mortality in a
single city, country, or region. However, less evidence is available on the
variation in the associations between temperature and mortality in multiple
countries, analyzed simultaneously.
METHODS: We obtained daily data on temperature and mortality in 306 communities
from 12 countries/regions (Australia, Brazil, Thailand, China, Taiwan, Korea,
Japan, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, United States, and Canada). Two-stage
analyses were used to assess the nonlinear and delayed relation between
temperature and mortality. In the first stage, a Poisson regression allowing
overdispersion with distributed lag nonlinear model was used to estimate the
community-specific temperature-mortality relation. In the second stage, a
multivariate meta-analysis was used to pool the nonlinear and delayed effects of 
ambient temperature at the national level, in each country.
RESULTS: The temperatures associated with the lowest mortality were around the
75th percentile of temperature in all the countries/regions, ranging from 66th
(Taiwan) to 80th (UK) percentiles. The estimated effects of cold and hot
temperatures on mortality varied by community and country. Meta-analysis results 
show that both cold and hot temperatures increased the risk of mortality in all
the countries/regions. Cold effects were delayed and lasted for many days,
whereas heat effects appeared quickly and did not last long.
CONCLUSIONS: People have some ability to adapt to their local climate type, but
both cold and hot temperatures are still associated with increased risk of
mortality. Public health strategies to alleviate the impact of ambient
temperatures are important, in particular in the context of climate change.

Artificial structures such as embankments built during the construction of
highways influence the surrounding airflow. Various types of damage can occur due
to changes in the wind velocity and temperature around highway embankments.
However, no study has accurately measured micrometeorological changes (wind
velocity and temperature) due to embankments. This study conducted a wind tunnel 
test and field measurement to identify changes in wind velocity and temperature
before and after the construction of embankments around roads. Changes in wind
velocity around an embankment after its construction were found to be influenced 
by the surrounding wind velocity, wind angle, and the level difference and
distance from the embankment. When the level difference from the embankment was
large and the distance was up to 3H, the degree of wind velocity declines was
found to be large. In changes in reference wind velocities around the embankment,
wind velocity increases were not proportional to the rate at which wind
velocities declined. The construction of the embankment influenced surrounding
temperatures. The degree of temperature change was large in locations with large 
level differences from the embankment at daybreak and during evening hours when
wind velocity changes were small.

OBJECTIVES: Climate change influences human health in various ways, and
quantitative assessments of the effect of climate change on health at national
level are becoming essential for environmental health management.
STUDY DESIGN: This study quantified the burden of disease attributable to climate
change in Korea using disability-adjusted life years (DALY), and projected how
this would change over time.
METHODS: Diseases related to climate change in Korea were selected, and
meteorological data for each risk factor of climate change were collected.
Mortality was calculated, and a database of incidence and prevalence was
established. After measuring the burden of each disease, the total burden of
disease related to climate change was assessed by multiplying
population-attributable fractions. Finally, an estimation model for the burden of
disease was built based on Korean climate data.
RESULTS: The total burden of disease related to climate change in Korea was 6.85 
DALY/1000 population in 2008. Cerebrovascular diseases induced by heat waves
accounted for 72.1% of the total burden of disease (hypertensive disease 1.82
DALY/1000 population, ischaemic heart disease 1.56 DALY/1000 population,
cerebrovascular disease 1.56 DALY/1000 population). According to the estimation
model, the total burden of disease will be 11.48 DALY/1000 population in 2100,
which is twice the total burden of disease in 2008.
CONCLUSIONS: This study quantified the burden of disease caused by climate change
in Korea, and provides valuable information for determining the priorities of
environmental health policy in East Asian countries with similar climates.

The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in the tropical eastern Indian Ocean
exhibits strong interannual variability, often co-occurring with positive Indian 
Ocean Dipole (pIOD) events. During what we identify as an extreme ITCZ event, a
drastic northward shift of atmospheric convection coincides with an anomalously
strong north-minus-south sea surface temperature (SST) gradient over the eastern 
equatorial Indian Ocean. Such shifts lead to severe droughts over the maritime
continent and surrounding islands but also devastating floods in southern parts
of the Indian subcontinent. Understanding future changes of the ITCZ is therefore
of major scientific and socioeconomic interest. Here we find a more-than-doubling
in the frequency of extreme ITCZ events under greenhouse warming, estimated from 
climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5
that are able to simulate such events. The increase is due to a mean state change
with an enhanced north-minus-south SST gradient and a weakened Walker
Circulation, facilitating smaller perturbations to shift the ITCZ northwards.

Water temperature is expected to increase in many parts of the world due to
global climate change. The change in water temperature may affect ecosystems
through alterations of the chemical properties or by affecting the susceptibility
of organisms. Perchlorate can disrupt thyroid function of an organism by
inhibiting iodide uptake. In the present study, the effect of water temperature
on perchlorate toxicity was evaluated using Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes).
Pairs of adult medaka fish were exposed to a sublethal concentration of sodium
perchlorate (100mg/L) and a control, at a 'low' (26°C), 'medium' (29°C) or 'high'
water temperature (33°C) for seven days. The effects of the water temperature on 
reproduction, thyroid hormones and cortisol concentrations were determined.
Transcription of several genes related to thyroid function and stress were also
investigated. Significant down-regulation of thyroid hormone receptor alpha
(THR-α) and beta (THR-β) transcripts and up-regulation of deiodinase 2 (DIO2)
transcripts were observed in the fish exposed to perchlorate. Thyroxine (T4)
concentrations were decreased, while triiodothyronine (T3) levels remained
constant following exposure to perchlorate, and this effect became more
pronounced under the high water temperature conditions (33°C). Up-regulation of
the DIO2 gene may explain these observations. The total number of spawned eggs
decreased slightly as the water temperature increased, and this reduction became 
significant when fish were exposed to perchlorate. Our observations indicate that
exposure to perchlorate could affect thyroid function and overall reproductive
fitness, and these effects could be aggravated under high water temperatures.

N2O, which is emitted mainly from nitrogen decomposition via bacteria, livestock 
manure, agricultural fertilizer use, fossil fuel combustion and waste
incineration, is classified as a substance that causes significant destruction of
the ozone layer. The N2O measurement methods for these emission sources may be
divided into chromatography, optical, and electrical current measurements.
Chromatography has been widely utilized for analyzing N2O. However, up until now,
few studies have been conducted on N2O using photoacoustic spectroscopy.
Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate performance of photoacoustic spectroscopy
in this regard based on laboratory and field test results. The repeatability of
photoacoustic spectroscopy was measured at 1.12%, which is lower than the
repeatability of 3.0% suggested by the ISO 1564 standard, so, it has shown an
excellent repeatability. The detection limit was determined to be 0.025 ppm, and 
the response time was confirmed to be 3 min and 26 s. The results of comparison
between these measurements and GC show that the latter has superior accuracy, but
mobility and convenience are superior for PAS. On the contrary, GC has a
continuous measurement limitation, but PAS makes it possible to conduct
continuous measurements. Therefore, PAS can be extremely useful to confirm the
characteristics of N2O emissions and to quantify their amount.

A credible accounting of national and regional inventories for the greenhouse gas
(GHG) reduction has emerged as one of the most significant current discussions.
This article assessed the regional GHG emissions by three categories of the waste
sector in Daejeon Metropolitan City (DMC), Korea, examined the potential for DMC 
to reduce GHG emission, and discussed the methodology modified from
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Korea national guidelines. During
the last five years, DMC's overall GHG emissions were 239 thousand tons CO2
eq./year from eleven public environmental infrastructure facilities, with a
population of 1.52 million. Of the three categories, solid waste
treatment/disposal contributes 68%, whilst wastewater treatment and others
contribute 22% and 10% respectively. Among GHG unit emissions per ton of waste
treatment, the biggest contributor was waste incineration of 694 kg CO2 eq./ton, 
followed by waste disposal of 483 kg CO2 eq./ton, biological treatment of solid
waste of 209 kg CO2 eq./ton, wastewater treatment of 0.241 kg CO2 eq./m(3), and
public water supplies of 0.067 kg CO2 eq./m(3). Furthermore, it is suggested that
the potential in reducing GHG emissions from landfill process can be as high as
47.5% by increasing landfill gas recovery up to 50%. Therefore, it is apparent
that reduction strategies for the main contributors of GHG emissions should take 
precedence over minor contributors and lead to the best practice for managing
GHGs abatement.

Water vapor in the upper troposphere strongly regulates the strength of
water-vapor feedback, which is the primary process for amplifying the response of
the climate system to external radiative forcings. Monitoring changes in
upper-tropospheric water vapor and scrutinizing the causes of such changes are
therefore of great importance for establishing the credibility of model
projections of past and future climates. Here, we use coupled ocean-atmosphere
model simulations under different climate-forcing scenarios to investigate
satellite-observed changes in global-mean upper-tropospheric water vapor. Our
analysis demonstrates that the upper-tropospheric moistening observed over the
period 1979-2005 cannot be explained by natural causes and results principally
from an anthropogenic warming of the climate. By attributing the observed
increase directly to human activities, this study verifies the presence of the
largest known feedback mechanism for amplifying anthropogenic climate change.

Allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) reduces allergen specific IgE (sIgE) levels
and achieves clinical and immunological tolerance by modulating innate and
adaptive immunological responses. Increased temperature and CO2 concentrations
caused by climate changes contribute to an increase of pollen count and
allergenicity that influences clinical SIT outcomes. In this study, we
investigated the changes of IgE binding components to tree and weed pollens in
pollinosis patients who showed a paradoxical increase of serum sIgE level during 
pollen-SIT. We enrolled nine patients who showed an increasing pattern of serum
sIgE level to alder, birch, ragweed and mugwort pollens by enzyme-linked
immunosorbant assay. IgE immunoblot analysis confirmed the intensification or new
generation of major IgE binding components that could be induced by climate
change. The findings suggest that the regular monitoring of sIgE levels and
symptom changes is required to improve the clinical outcomes of SIT in patients
undergoing SIT for tree and weed pollens.

With 3,480 E. coli strains isolated from the Yeongsan River basin, South Korea,
correlations between phylogenetic groups and horizontal fluorophore enhanced
rep-PCR (HFERP) genotypes were examined, and environmental factors affecting E.
coli phylogenetic groups in the river water were determined. Interestingly,
multidimentional scaling (MDS) analyses based on HFERP DNA fingerprint data
indicated that E. coli in phylogenetic groups A and B1 were uniquely clustered.
Results of self-organized maps (SOMs) analyses also indicated that E. coli
phylogenetic groups were seasonally affected by water temperature, with greater
occurrences of phylogenetic groups A and B1 in low and high temperature seasons, 
respectively. The presence of E. coli in phylogenetic groups A and B1 were
inversely related. Furthermore, redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that
phylogenetic group B1 correlated positively with temperature, strain diversity,
and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) but negatively with phylogenetic group A.
Results of this study indicated that while E. coli strains could be clustered
based on their genotypes and environment conditions, their phylogenetic groups
did not change in relation to the same conditions. The distributional differences
of phylogenetic groups among E. coli populations in different environments may be
caused by different genomic adaptability and plasticity of E. coli strains
belonging to each phylogenetic group. Although several previous studies have
reported different E. coli ecological structures depending on their origins, this
study is a first description of the specific environmental factors affecting E.
coli phylogenetic groups in river water.

BACKGROUND: Heat stroke contributes considerably to morbidity and mortality in
hot weather, but it is unclear whether pre-existing medical conditions increase
the risk of heat stroke. The purpose of this study was to assess the association 
between heat stroke and pre-existing medical conditions in South Korea.
METHODS: A case-control study was conducted using data from a nationwide
surveillance system for heat illnesses in 2012. Individuals with heat stroke were
identified and compared to control subjects with mild heat illness such as heat
exhaustion, heat edema, heat cramps, and heat syncope. Categories of pre-existing
medical conditions included cardio/cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, 
neuropsychiatric disorder, and diabetes mellitus. Associations between heat
stroke and pre-existing medical conditions were assessed by multivariate logistic
regression analyses.
RESULTS: Of 968 eligible patients, 178 (18.4%) presented with heat stroke.
Patients with pre-existing medical conditions were relatively greater in the heat
stroke group than in the control group (40.4% and 23.9%, respectively).
Neuropsychiatric disorder was associated with an increased odds of heat stroke
after adjustment for covariates (adjusted odds ratio, 7.69; 95% CI, 4.06-14.54). 
There were no significant relationships between heat stroke and other medical
conditions (cardio/cerebrovascular disease: 0.66, 0.40-1.06; respiratory disease:
1.44, 0.35-5.89; diabetes mellitus: 1.16, 0.58-2.34).
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-existing neuropsychiatric disorder was associated with an
increased risk of heat stroke. National strategies and clinical guidance for such
patients should be initiated to prevent fatal events.

Under the Kyoto Protocol, a global governmental response to climate change,
protocol signatories make an effort to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. South 
Korea is not included in the list of Annex I countries; yet, South Korea is the
seventh highest emitter of CO2. The South Korean government has enacted various
institutional policies to encourage greenhouse gas reductions. While previous
studies have focused on the guidance that reflects the stance of suppliers in the
carbon market, this study focuses on South Korean firms' actual demand for forest
carbon credits. By applying the contingent valuation method, we estimated
domestic firms' willingness to pay for forest carbon credits. We then applied a
rank-ordered logistic regression to confirm whether the rank of forest carbon
credits, as compared to any other carbon credit, is influenced by a firm's
characteristics. The results showed that Korean firms are willing to pay 5.45
USD/tCO2 and 7.77 USD/tCO2 for forest carbon credits in domestic and overseas
forest carbon projects, respectively. Therefore, the introduction of forest
carbon credits in the Korean carbon market seems reasonable. Analysis of the
priority rankings of forest carbon credits, however, demonstrated that forestry
projects were least likely to be ranked by firms as their first priority.
Although relative preferences for forest carbon credits were influenced by
individual firms' characteristics such as prior experience of environmental CSR
related activities and whether the firm established an emissions reduction plan, 
the impact of perceived behavior control, whether the firm was included in the
emissions target management scheme on forest carbon credits was negligible.
Therefore, forest carbon credits are not a feasible solution without strong
government support or institutional instruments. The results of this study are
expected to provide policy makers with realistic approaches to formulate climatic
change-related policies.

Renewed interest in managing C balance in soils is motivated by increasing
atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and consequent climate change. Here,
experiments were conducted in soil columns to determine C mass balances with and 
without addition of CaSO4-minerals (anhydrite and gypsum), which were
hypothesized to promote soil organic carbon (SOC) retention and soil inorganic
carbon (SIC) precipitation as calcite under slightly alkaline conditions. Changes
in C contents in three phases (gas, liquid and solid) were measured in
unsaturated soil columns tested for one year and comprehensive C mass balances
were determined. The tested soil columns had no C inputs, and only C utilization 
by microbial activity and C transformations were assumed in the C chemistry. The 
measurements showed that changes in C inventories occurred through two processes,
SOC loss and SIC gain. However, the measured SOC losses in the treated columns
were lower than their corresponding control columns, indicating that the
amendments promoted SOC retention. The SOC losses resulted mostly from microbial 
respiration and loss of CO2 to the atmosphere rather than from chemical leaching.
Microbial oxidation of SOC appears to have been suppressed by increased Ca(2+)
and SO4(2)(-) from dissolution of CaSO4 minerals. For the conditions tested, SIC 
accumulation per m(2) soil area under CaSO4-treatment ranged from 130 to 260 g C 
m(-1) infiltrated water (20-120 g C m(-1) infiltrated water as net C benefit).
These results demonstrate the potential for increasing C sequestration in
slightly alkaline soils via CaSO4-treatment.

Cyanobacteria are capable of thriving in almost all environments. Recent changes 
in climatic conditions due to increased human activities favor the occurrence and
severity of harmful cyanobacterial bloom all over the world. Knowledge of the
regulation of cyanotoxins by the various environmental factors is essential for
effective management of toxic cyanobacterial bloom. In recent years, progress in 
the field of molecular mechanisms involved in cyanotoxin production has paved the
way for assessing the role of various factors on the cyanotoxin production. In
this review, we present an overview of the influence of various environmental
factors on the production of major group of cyanotoxins, including microcystins, 
nodularin, cylindrospermopsin, anatoxins and saxitoxins.

"How far are we in implementing climate change and health action in the WHO
European Region?" This was the question addressed to representatives of WHO
European Member States of the working group on health in climate change (HIC).
Twenty-two Member States provided answers to a comprehensive questionnaire that
focused around eight thematic areas (Governance; Vulnerability, impact and
adaptation (health) assessments; Adaptation strategies and action plans; Climate 
change mitigation; Strengthening health systems; Raising awareness and building
capacity; Greening health services; and Sharing best practices). Strong areas of 
development are climate change vulnerability and impact assessments, as well as
strengthening health systems and awareness raising. Areas where implementation
would benefit from further action are the development of National Health
Adaptation Plans, greening health systems, sharing best practice and reducing
greenhouse gas emissions in other sectors. At the Parma Conference in 2010, the
European Ministerial Commitment to Act on climate change and health and the
European Regional Framework for Action to protect health from climate change were
endorsed by fifty three European Member States. The results of this questionnaire
are the most comprehensive assessment so far of the progress made by WHO European
Member States to protecting public health from climate change since the
agreements in Parma and the World Health Assembly Resolution in 2008.

Sediments cored along the southwestern Iberian margin during Integrated Ocean
Drilling Program Expedition 339 provide constraints on Mediterranean Outflow
Water (MOW) circulation patterns from the Pliocene epoch to the present day.
After the Strait of Gibraltar opened (5.33 million years ago), a limited volume
of MOW entered the Atlantic. Depositional hiatuses indicate erosion by bottom
currents related to higher volumes of MOW circulating into the North Atlantic,
beginning in the late Pliocene. The hiatuses coincide with regional tectonic
events and changes in global thermohaline circulation (THC). This suggests that
MOW influenced Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), THC, and
climatic shifts by contributing a component of warm, saline water to northern
latitudes while in turn being influenced by plate tectonics.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Miscanthus is a perennial C4 grass that is a leading
potential feedstock crop for the emerging bioenergy industry in North America,
Europe and China. However, only a single, sterile genotype of M. × giganteus
(M×g), a nothospecies derived from diploid M. sinensis (Msi) and tetraploid M.
sacchariflorus (Msa), is currently available to farmers for biomass production.
To facilitate breeding of Miscanthus, this study characterized genetic diversity 
and population structure of Msi in its native range of East Asia.
METHODS: A total of 767 accessions were studied, including 617 Msi from most of
its native range in China, Japan and South Korea, and 77 ornamental cultivars and
43 naturalized individuals from the USA. Accessions were evaluated with 21 207
restriction site-associated DNA sequencing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
markers, 424 GoldenGate SNPs and ten plastid microsatellite markers.
KEY RESULTS: Six genetic clusters of Msi from geographically distinct regions in 
Asia were identified. Genetic data indicated that (1) south-eastern China was the
origin of Msi populations found in temperate eastern Asia, which is consistent
with this area probably having been a refugium during the last glacial maximum
(LGM); (2) Msi migrated directly from south-eastern China to Japan before
migrating to the same latitudes in China and Korea, which is consistent with the 
known sequence of warming post-LGM; (3) ornamental Msi cultivars were derived
from the southern Japan population, and US naturalized populations were derived
from a sub-set of the ornamental cultivars; and (4) many ornamental cultivars
previously described as Msi have hybrid ancestry from Msa and Msi, whereas US
naturalized populations of Msi do not.
CONCLUSIONS: Population structure of Msi was driven by patterns of warming since 
the LGM, and secondarily by geographical barriers. This study will facilitate
germplasm conservation, association analyses and identification of potential
heterotic groups for the improvement of Miscanthus as a bioenergy crop.

Currently, unprecedented levels of damage arising from major weather events have 
been experienced in a number of major cities worldwide. Furthermore, the
frequency and the scale of these disasters appear to be increasing and this is
viewed by some as tangible proof of climate change. In the urbanized areas sewer 
overflows and resulting inundation are attributed to the conversion of previous
surfaces into impervious surfaces, resulting in increased volumes of runoff which
exceed the capacity of sewer systems and in particular combined sewer systems. In
this study, the characteristics of sewer overflows and inundation have been
analyzed in a repeatedly flooded zone in the city of Cheongju in Korea. This
included an assessment of inundation in a 50-year storm event with total rainfall
of 165 mm. A detailed XP-SWMM 2D model was assembled and run to simulate the
interaction of the sewage system overflows and surface inundation to determine if
inundation is due to hydraulic capacity limitations in the sewers or limitations 
in surface inlet capacities or a combination of both. Calibration was undertaken 
using observation at three locations (PT #1, PT #2, PT #3) within the study area.
In the case of the subsurface flow calibration, R(2) value of 0.91 and 0.78
respectively were achieved at PT #1 and PT #2. Extremely good agreement between
observed and predicted surface flow depths was achieved also at PT #1 and PT #2. 
However, at PT #3 the predicted flow depth was 4 cm lower than the observed
depth, which was attributed to the impact of buildings on the local flow
distribution. Areas subject to flooding were classified as either Type A (due to 
insufficient hydraulic capacity of a sewer), Type B (which is an area without
flooding notwithstanding insufficient hydraulic capacity of a sewer) or Type C
(due to inlet limitations, i.e. there is hydraulic capacity in a sewer which is
not utilized). In the total flooded zone, 24% was classified as Type A (10.2 ha) 
and 25% was classified as Type C (2.61 ha). It was concluded that greater
attention should be paid to the area classified as Type B, which covers 50.5%
(5.15 ha) of the total flooded zone.

The subarctic region is highly responsive and vulnerable to climate change.
Understanding the structure of subarctic soil microbial communities is essential 
for predicting the response of the subarctic soil environment to climate change. 
To determine the composition of the bacterial community and its relationship with
soil properties, we investigated the bacterial community structure and properties
of surface soil from the moist acidic tussock tundra in Council, Alaska. We
collected 70 soil samples with 25-m intervals between sampling points from 0-10
cm to 10-20 cm depths. The bacterial community was analyzed by pyrosequencing of 
16S rRNA genes, and the following soil properties were analyzed: soil moisture
content (MC), pH, total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), and inorganic nitrogen 
(NH4+ and NO3-). The community compositions of the two different depths showed
that Alphaproteobacteria decreased with soil depth. Among the soil properties
measured, soil pH was the most significant factor correlating with bacterial
community in both upper and lower-layer soils. Bacterial community similarity
based on jackknifed unweighted unifrac distance showed greater similarity across 
horizontal layers than through the vertical depth. This study showed that soil
depth and pH were the most important soil properties determining bacterial
community structure of the subarctic tundra soil in Council, Alaska.

This study examines the role of Asian monsoons on transport and spatial
variability of atmospheric CO2 over the Indian subcontinent, using transport
modeling tools and available surface observations from two atmospheric CO2
monitoring sites Sinhagad (SNG) and Cape Rama (CRI) in the western part of
peninsular India. The regional source contributions to these sites arise from the
horizontal flow in conduits within the planetary boundary layer. Greater CO2
variability, greater than 15 ppm, is observed during winter, while it is reduced 
nearly by half during summer. The SNG air sampling site is more susceptible to
narrow regional terrestrial fluxes transported from the Indo-Gangetic Plains in
January, and to wider upwind marine source regions from the Arabian Sea in July. 
The Western Ghats mountains appear to play a role in the seasonal variability at 
SNG by trapping polluted air masses associated with weak monsoonal winds. A
Lagrangian back-trajectory analysis further suggests that the horizontal extent
of regional sensitivity increases from north to south over the Indian
subcontinent in January (Boreal winter).

In order to mitigate CO2 accumulation and decrease the rate of global warming and
climate change, we previously presented a strategy for the development of an
efficient CO2 capture and utilization system. The system employs two recombinant 
enzymes, carbonic anhydrase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, which were
originated from microalgae. Although utilization of this integrated system would 
require a large quantity of high quality PEPCase protein, such quantities could
be produced by increasing the solubility of the Phaeodactylum tricornutum PEPCase
1 (PtPEPCase 1) protein in the Escherichia coli heterologous expression system.
We first expressed the putative mitochondria targeting peptide- and chloroplast
transit peptide-truncated proteins of PtPEPCase 1, mPtPEPCase 1 and cPtPEPCase 1,
respectively, in E. coli. After affinity chromatography, the amount of purified
PEPCase protein from 500mL of E. coli culture was greatest for cPtPEPCase 1
(1.99mg), followed by mPtPEPCase 1 (0.82mg) and PtPEPCase 1 (0.61mg).
Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of mPtPEPCase 1 and cPtPEPCase 1 showed
approximately 1.6-fold (32.19 units/mg) and 3-fold (59.48 units/mg) increases,
respectively. Therefore, cPtPEPCase 1 purified using the E. coli heterogeneous
expression system could be a strong candidate for a platform technology to
capture CO2 and produce value-added four-carbon platform chemicals.

ABSTRACT: Climate Change like many global problems nowadays is recognized as a
threat to the international security and cooperation. In theoretical terms, it is
being securitized and included in the traditional security studies. Climate
change and its accompanying environmental degradation are perceived to be a
threat that can have incalculable consequences on the international community.
The consequences are said to have more effects in small island developing nations
and Africa where many States are fragile and overwhelmed with mounting
challenges. In recent years, the security implications of the climate change are 
being addressed from national, regional and multilateral level. Against this
backdrop, this paper intends to contribute to the debate on climate change and
international security and present a broader perspective on the discussion. The
paper will draw from the EU-Africa partnership on climate change and is
structured as follows: the first part introduces the background of the
international climate change policy and its securitization, the second part
covers the EU-Africa relations and EU-Africa partnership on climate change, and
the third part discusses the Congo Basin Forest Partnership as a concrete example
of EU-Africa Partnership on Climate Change. Lastly, the paper concludes by
drawing some conclusions and offers some policy perspectives and recommendations.

Rapid Arctic warming and sea-ice reduction in the Arctic Ocean are widely
attributed to anthropogenic climate change. The Arctic warming exceeds the global
average warming because of feedbacks that include sea-ice reduction and other
dynamical and radiative feedbacks. We find that the most prominent annual mean
surface and tropospheric warming in the Arctic since 1979 has occurred in
northeastern Canada and Greenland. In this region, much of the year-to-year
temperature variability is associated with the leading mode of large-scale
circulation variability in the North Atlantic, namely, the North Atlantic
Oscillation. Here we show that the recent warming in this region is strongly
associated with a negative trend in the North Atlantic Oscillation, which is a
response to anomalous Rossby wave-train activity originating in the tropical
Pacific. Atmospheric model experiments forced by prescribed tropical sea surface 
temperatures simulate the observed circulation changes and associated
tropospheric and surface warming over northeastern Canada and Greenland.
Experiments from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (ref. 16)
models with prescribed anthropogenic forcing show no similar circulation changes 
related to the North Atlantic Oscillation or associated tropospheric warming.
This suggests that a substantial portion of recent warming in the northeastern
Canada and Greenland sector of the Arctic arises from unforced natural
variability.

Lead (Pb) isotopic compositions and concentrations, and barium (Ba) and indium
(In) concentrations have been analysed at sub-annual resolution in three sections
from a <110 m ice core dated to the 18th and 20th centuries, as well as snow pit 
samples dated to 2004/2005, recovered from the East Rongbuk Glacier in the
high-altitude Himalayas. Ice core sections indicate that atmospheric chemistry
prior to ~1,953 was controlled by mineral dust inputs, with no discernible
volcanic or anthropogenic contributions. Eighteenth century monsoon ice core
chemistry is indicative of dominant contributions from local Himalayan sources;
non-monsoon ice core chemistry is linked to contributions from local (Himalayan),
regional (Indian/Thar Desert) and long-range (North Africa, Central Asia)
sources. Twentieth century monsoon and non-monsoon ice core data demonstrate
similar seasonal sources of mineral dust, however with a transition to
less-radiogenic isotopic signatures that suggests local and regional
climate/environmental change. The snow pit record demonstrates natural and
anthropogenic contributions during both seasons, with increased anthropogenic
influence during non-monsoon times. Monsoon anthropogenic inputs are most likely 
sourced to South/South-East Asia and/or India, whereas non-monsoon anthropogenic 
inputs are most likely sourced to India and Central Asia.

Reconstruction of atmospheric CO2 during times of past abrupt climate change may 
help us better understand climate-carbon cycle feedbacks. Previous ice core
studies reveal simultaneous increases in atmospheric CO2 and Antarctic
temperature during times when Greenland and the northern hemisphere experienced
very long, cold stadial conditions during the last ice age. Whether this
relationship extends to all of the numerous stadial events in the Greenland ice
core record has not been clear. Here we present a high-resolution record of
atmospheric CO2 from the Siple Dome ice core, Antarctica for part of the last ice
age. We find that CO2 does not significantly change during the short Greenlandic 
stadial events, implying that the climate system perturbation that produced the
short stadials was not strong enough to substantially alter the carbon cycle.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between temperature and myocardial infarction has
not been fully explained. In this study, we identified the threshold temperature 
and examined the relationship between temperature and emergency admissions due to
MI in Korea.
METHODS: Poisson generalized additive model analyses were used to assess the
short-term effects of temperature (mean, maximum, minimum, diurnal) on MI
emergency visits, after controlling for meteorological variable and air pollution
(PM10, NO2). We defined the threshold temperature when the inflection point
showed a statistically significant difference in the regression coefficients of
the generalized additive models (GAMs) analysis. The analysis was performed on
the following subgroups: geographical region, gender, age (<75 years or ≥ 75
years), and MI status (STEMI or non-STEMI).
RESULTS: The threshold temperatures during heat exposure were for the maximum
temperature as 25.5-31.5°C and for the mean temperature as 27.5-28.5°C. The
threshold temperatures during cold exposure were for the minimum temperature as
-2.5-1.5°C. Relative risks (RRs) of emergency visits above hot temperature
thresholds ranged from 1.02 to 1.30 and those below cold temperature thresholds
ranged from 1.01 to 1.05. We also observed increased RRs ranged from 1.02 to 1.65
of emergency visits when temperatures changes on a single day or on successive
days.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a relationship between temperature and MI occurrence during
both heat and cold exposure at the threshold temperature. Diurnal temperature or 
temperature change on successive days also increased MI risk.

An interhemispheric hydrologic seesaw--in which latitudinal migrations of the
Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) produce simultaneous wetting (increased
precipitation) in one hemisphere and drying in the other--has been discovered in 
some tropical and subtropical regions. For instance, Chinese and Brazilian
subtropical speleothem (cave formations such as stalactites and stalagmites)
records show opposite trends in time series of oxygen isotopes (a proxy for
precipitation variability) at millennial to orbital timescales, suggesting that
hydrologic cycles were antiphased in the northerly versus southerly subtropics.
This tropical to subtropical hydrologic phenomenon is likely to be an initial and
important climatic response to orbital forcing. The impacts of such an
interhemispheric hydrologic seesaw on higher-latitude regions and the global
climate system, however, are unknown. Here we show that the antiphasing seen in
the tropical records is also present in both hemispheres of the mid-latitude
western Pacific Ocean. Our results are based on a new 550,000-year record of the 
growth frequency of speleothems from the Korean peninsula, which we compare to
Southern Hemisphere equivalents. The Korean data are discontinuous and derived
from 24 separate speleothems, but still allow the identification of periods of
peak speleothem growth and, thus, precipitation. The clear hemispheric
antiphasing indicates that the sphere of influence of the interhemispheric
hydrologic seesaw over the past 550,000 years extended at least to the
mid-latitudes, such as northeast Asia, and that orbital-timescale ITCZ shifts can
have serious effects on temperate climate systems. Furthermore, our result
implies that insolation-driven ITCZ dynamics may provoke water vapour and
vegetation feedbacks in northern mid-latitude regions and could have regulated
global climate conditions throughout the late Quaternary ice age cycles.

A pilot-scale staged anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor (SAF-MBR) was
operated continuously for 485 days, without chemical cleaning of membranes,
treating primary-settled domestic wastewater with wastewater temperature between 
8 and 30°C and total hydraulic retention time (HRT) between 4.6 and 6.8h. Average
chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) removals
averaged 81% and 85%, respectively, during the first winter at 8-15°C before full
acclimation had occurred. However, subsequently when fully acclimated, summer and
winter COD removals of 94% and 90% and BOD5 removals of 98% and 90%,
respectively, were obtained with average effluent COD never higher than 23 mg/L
nor BOD5 higher than 9 mg/L. Operational energy requirement of 0.23 kW h/m(3)
could be met with primary and secondary methane production, and could be reduced 
further through hydraulic change. Biosolids production in all seasons averaged
0.051 g volatile suspended solids per g COD removed.

Globally, the East Asian monsoon region is one of the richest environments in
terms of biodiversity. The region is undergoing rapid human development, yet its 
river ecosystems have not been well studied. Global warming represents a major
challenge to the survival of species in this region and makes it necessary to
assess and reduce the potential consequences of warming on species of
conservation concern. We projected the effects of global warming on stream insect
(Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera [EOPT]) diversity and
predicted the changes of geographical ranges for 121 species throughout South
Korea. Plecoptera was the most sensitive (decrease of 71.4% in number of species 
from the 2000s through the 2080s) order, whereas Odonata benefited (increase of
66.7% in number of species from the 2000s through the 2080s) from the effects of 
global warming. The impact of global warming on stream insects was predicted to
be minimal prior to the 2060s; however, by the 2080s, species extirpation of up
to 20% in the highland areas and 2% in the lowland areas were predicted. The
projected responses of stream insects under global warming indicated that species
occupying specific habitats could undergo major reductions in habitat.
Nevertheless, habitat of 33% of EOPT (including two-thirds of Odonata and
one-third of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) was predicted to
increase due to global warming. The community compositions predicted by
generalized additive models varied over this century, and a large difference in
community structure in the highland areas was predicted between the 2000s and the
2080s. However, stream insect communities, especially Odonata, Plecoptera, and
Trichoptera, were predicted to become more homogenous under global warming.

The water deer (Hydropotes inermis) is one of the rarest species of deer in the
family Cervidae. Only two subspecies exist in East Asia, and few studies have
examined the genetic characteristics of the species. Here, we investigated the
genetic diversity, phylogeny and population differentiation of the Korean
subspecies (H. inermis argyropus). Seventeen mitochondrial D-loop haplotypes (822
bp) were detected and analyzed from 107 individual samples, together with a
Chinese subspecies (H. inermis inermis) haplotype. The genetic diversity of the
Korean subspecies is lower (π = 0.756%, h = 0.867) than that of the Chinese
subspecies estimated in a previous study. This low genetic diversity may result
from historical anthropogenic disturbances and/or a founder effect during the
glacial period. The phylogenetic tree and median-joining network showed no
location-specific distribution of D-loop haplotypes, but revealed two major
lineages, A and B, of water deer. The A and B lineages were separated from each
other at the beginning of the Pleistocene era (2.1-1.3 million years ago), with a
genetic divergence of 1.332 ± 0.340%. The genetic divergence within lineages A
and B was 0.525 ± 0.167% and 0.264 ± 0.113%, respectively. This suggests that
climate change affected the division of the two lineages. Water deer sampled from
the three Korean regions (26 locations) were slightly distinct in their genetic
structure (AMOVA: F(ST) = 0.28416, P < 0.00001; Φ(ST) = 0.19239, P < 0.00001).
Such slight population differentiation may be derived from differential dispersal
ability in males and females. The use of genetic markers, such as nuclear
microsatellite and Y-linked DNA markers, and samples collected from various
localities in East Asia should improve our understanding of the water deer's
genetic characteristics.

This study developed an index-based robust decision making framework for
watershed management dealing with water quantity and quality issues in a changing
climate. It consists of two parts of management alternative development and
analysis. The first part for alternative development consists of six steps: 1) to
understand the watershed components and process using HSPF model, 2) to identify 
the spatial vulnerability ranking using two indices: potential streamflow
depletion (PSD) and potential water quality deterioration (PWQD), 3) to quantify 
the residents' preferences on water management demands and calculate the
watershed evaluation index which is the weighted combinations of PSD and PWQD, 4)
to set the quantitative targets for water quantity and quality, 5) to develop a
list of feasible alternatives and 6) to eliminate the unacceptable alternatives. 
The second part for alternative analysis has three steps: 7) to analyze all
selected alternatives with a hydrologic simulation model considering various
climate change scenarios, 8) to quantify the alternative evaluation index
including social and hydrologic criteria with utilizing multi-criteria decision
analysis methods and 9) to prioritize all options based on a minimax regret
strategy for robust decision. This framework considers the uncertainty inherent
in climate models and climate change scenarios with utilizing the minimax regret 
strategy, a decision making strategy under deep uncertainty and thus this
procedure derives the robust prioritization based on the multiple utilities of
alternatives from various scenarios. In this study, the proposed procedure was
applied to the Korean urban watershed, which has suffered from streamflow
depletion and water quality deterioration. Our application shows that the
framework provides a useful watershed management tool for incorporating
quantitative and qualitative information into the evaluation of various policies 
with regard to water resource planning and management.

Aerosols have been associated with large uncertainties in estimates of the
radiation budget and cloud formation processes in the Arctic. This paper reports 
the results of a study of in situ measurements of hygroscopicity, fraction of
volatile species, mixing state, and off-line morphological and elemental analysis
of Aitken and accumulation mode particles in the Arctic (Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard) in
May and September 2012. The accumulation mode particles were more abundant in May
than in September. This difference was due to more air mass flow from lower
latitude continental areas, weaker vertical mixing, and less wet scavenging in
May than in September, which may have led to a higher amount of long-range
transport aerosols entering the Arctic in the spring. The Aitken mode particles
observed intermittently in May were produced by nucleation, absent significant
external mixing, whereas the accumulation mode particles displayed significant
external mixing. The occurrence of an external mixing state was observed more
often in May than in September and more often in accumulation mode particles than
in Aitken mode particles, and it was associated more with continental air masses 
(Siberian) than with other air masses. The external mixing of the accumulation
mode particles in May may have been caused by multiple sources (i.e., long-range 
transport aerosols with aging and marine aerosols). These groups of externally
mixed particles were subdivided into different mixing structures (internal
mixtures of predominantly sulfates and volatile organics without nonvolatile
species and internal mixtures of sulfates and nonvolatile components, such as sea
salts, minerals, and soot). The variations in the mixing states and chemical
species of the Arctic aerosols in terms of their sizes, air masses, and seasons
suggest that the continuous size-dependent measurements observed in this study
are useful for obtaining better estimates of the effects of these aerosols on
climate change.

The sources of halogenated compounds in East Asia associated with stratospheric
ozone depletion and climate change are relatively poorly understood.
High-precision in situ measurements of 18 halogenated compounds and carbonyl
sulfide (COS) made at Gosan, Jeju Island, Korea, from November 2007 to December
2011 were analyzed by a positive matrix factorization (PMF). Seven major
industrial sources were identified from the enhanced concentrations of
halogenated compounds observed at Gosan and corresponding concentration-based
source contributions were also suggested: primary aluminum production explaining 
37% of total concentration enhancements, solvent usage of which source
apportionment is 25%, fugitive emissions from HCFC/HFC production with 11%,
refrigerant replacements (9%), semiconductor/electronics industry (9%), foam
blowing agents (6%), and fumigation (3%). Statistical trajectory analysis was
applied to specify the potential emission regions for seven sources using back
trajectories. Primary aluminum production, solvent usage and fugitive emission
sources were mainly contributed by China. Semiconductor/electronics sources were 
dominantly located in Korea. Refrigerant replacement, fumigation and foam blowing
agent sources were spread throughout East Asian countries. The specified
potential source regions are consistent with country-based consumptions and
emission patterns, verifying the PMF analysis results. The industry-based
emission sources of halogenated compounds identified in this study help improve
our understanding of the East Asian countries' industrial contributions to
halogenated compound emissions.

Leptospirosis is an important public health problem in the Republic of Korea
(ROK), occurring sporadically or in outbreaks during the autumn season. Wild
rodents, Apodemus agrarius, have been mainly involved in human leptospirosis. The
majority of carrier animals are infected with Leptospira interrogans serovar lai.
The characteristic pulmonary involvement or hemorrhage may increase the clinical 
severity or result in fatal outcomes, and these aspects continue to be a threat
to people in endemic areas. While the disease incidence has been relatively low
in recent years, there have been newer findings of livestock (zoo animals and
racing horses) and rats (Rattus norvegicus) captured in urban environments as
potential animal carriers. Many avenues of research are still open to define
current changes in ecology, epidemiology, and the disease burden in both humans
and animals in the ROK, together with global warming and climate change issues.
In addition, national policy regarding the weighted wildlife monitoring system
and the enhanced disease surveillance program is required to facilitate better
monitoring and understanding of this disease.

The studies of cyanobacterial blooms resulting from eutrophication or climate
change and investigation of changes in the cyanobacterial community in freshwater
environments are critical for the management of drinking water. Therefore, we
investigated the cyanobacterial communities at 6 sites along the Nakdong River in
South Korea from May 2012 to October 2012 by using high-throughput sequencing
techniques and studied their relationship with various geochemical factors at
sampling sites. Diverse genera (total of 175 genera) were detected within the
cyanobacteria, and changes in their compositions were analyzed. The genus
Prochlorococcus predominated in the May samples, especially in those obtained
from the upstream part of the river, whereas the relative abundance of
Microcystis and Anabaena increased with increase in water temperature. The
relationship between the cyanobacterial community and environmental factors was
analyzed by canonical correlation analysis, and the correlation between harmful
cyanobacteria and chemical factors was analyzed by nonmetric multidimensional
scaling ordination. Various environmental factors such as dissolved oxygen, pH,
electric conductivity, temperature were found to affect the cyanobacterial
communities in the river. The results of this study could help in the management 
of freshwater environments and in maintenance of drinking water quality.

Medicine, Cheonan, Korea.

OBJECTIVES: Allergic disease may be increased by climate change. Recent reports
have shown that typhoon and heavy rain increase allergic disease locally by
concentration of airborne allergens of pollen, ozone, and fungus, which are
causes of allergic disease. The objective of this study was to determine whether 
typhoon and heavy rain increase allergic disease in Korea.
METHODS: This study included allergic disease patients of the area declared as a 
special disaster zone due to storms and heavy rains from 2003 to 2009. The study 
used information from the Korea Meteorological Administration, and from the
National Health Insurance Service for allergic diseases (asthma, allergic
rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis).
RESULTS: During a storm period, the numbers of allergy rhinitis and atopic
dermatitis outpatients increased [rate ratio (RR) = 1.191; range, 1.150-1.232] on
the sixth lag day. However, the number of asthma outpatients decreased
(RR = 0.900; range, 0.862-0.937) on the sixth lag day after a disaster period.
During a storm period, the numbers of allergic rhinitis outpatients (RR = 1.075; 
range, 1.018-1.132) and atopy outpatients increased (RR = 1.134; range,
1.113-1.155) on the seventh lag day. However, the number of asthma outpatients
decreased to RR value of 0.968 (range, 0.902-1.035) on the fifth lag day.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that typhoon and heavy rain increase allergic
disease apart from asthma. More study is needed to explain the decrease in
asthma.

Willingness to pay for avoiding infection of climate change diseases, in
particular tsutsugamushi disease.

Rhee HC(1).

Author information: 
(1)School of Economics, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea .

OBJECTIVES: As the prevalence of tsutsugamushi disease has tripled over the past 
decade to affect 8307 people in October 2012, this study is conducted to estimate
the willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid infection of tsutsugamushi disease in order
to analyze the loss of value caused by climate change diseases.
METHODS: The double-bounded dichotomous choice of contingent valuation method was
used to estimate the WTP to avoid infection of tsutsugamushi disease, through
surveys conducted in the patient group (n = 120) and the control group (n = 240).
RESULTS: More young people in the family, higher level of awareness of risks
caused by climate change, more male members (as opposed to female), higher
income, lower suggested bid, and greater WTP, is better positioned to avoid
infection of disease. The mean of the amount of WTP has been estimated to be 3689
Kwon per month.
CONCLUSION: As people have become increasingly aware of climate change diseases, 
WTP to avoid infection of tsutsugamushi disease has increased accordingly. The
implicit loss of value due to climate change diseases is becoming increasingly
higher. Therefore, there should be stronger and more aggressive promotional
activities to prevent people from being infected with tsutsugamushi disease and
to build a healthier society free from climate change diseases.

Migratory birds may disperse parasites across ecological barriers, and recent
climate change may alter the pattern of ectoparasite dispersal via changed
patterns of bird migration. In order to document the parasitization of migratory 
birds by Ixodidae ticks on Jeju Island in Korea, we examined 934 migratory birds 
comprising 75 species for ticks from 2010 to 2012. In total, 313 ticks were
collected from 74 migratory birds across 17 avian species and identified based on
morphological keys. These ticks represented six species: Haemaphysalis flava, H. 
formosensis, H. longicornis, H. concinna, Ixodes turdus and I. nipponensis. Of
particular note was the presence of H. formosensis, a species not previously
reported to have been found in Korea, and H. concinna, which had not been
previously reported on Jeju Island. The dominant tick species found were H. flava
(226 ticks, 72.2 %) and I. turdus (54 ticks, 17.3 %), and ground-dwelling
thrushes such as Pale thrushes (Turdus pallidus; 39 birds, 52.7 %) were the most 
important hosts. Although H. longicornis is the most abundant and prevalent
terrestrial tick on Jeju Island, the species accounted for only 3.8 % of the
total ticks collected in this study, suggesting that ticks on migratory birds may
differ from the local tick fauna and that exotic ticks may be introduced via
migratory birds. Therefore, long-term programs for tick and tick-borne disease
surveillance are recommended to understand the role of migratory animals in the
introduction of exotic species and associated pathogens and in life cycles of
ticks at different stages in this region.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the socio-demographic characteristics and
medical causes of death among meteorological disaster casualties and compared
them with deaths from all causes.
METHODS: Based on the death data provided by the National Statistical Office from
2000 to 2011, the authors analyzed the gender, age, and region of 709 casualties 
whose external causes were recorded as natural events (X330-X389). Exact matching
was applied to compare between deaths from meteorological disasters and all
deaths.
RESULTS: The total number of deaths for last 12 years was 2 728 505. After exact 
matching, 642 casualties of meteorological disasters were matched to 6815
all-cause deaths, which were defined as general deaths. The mean age of the
meteorological disaster casualties was 51.56, which was lower than that of the
general deaths by 17.02 (p<0.001). As for the gender ratio, 62.34% of the
meteorological event casualties were male. While 54.09% of the matched all-cause 
deaths occurred at a medical institution, only 7.6% of casualties from
meteorological events did. As for occupation, the rate of those working in
agriculture, forestry, and fishery jobs was twice as high in the casualties from 
meteorological disasters as that in the general deaths (p<0.001). Meteorological 
disaster-related injuries like drowning were more prevalent in the casualties of 
meteorological events (57.48%). The rate of amputation and crushing injury in
deaths from meteorological disasters was three times as high as in the general
deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: The new information gained on the particular characteristics
contributing to casualties from meteorological events will be useful for
developing prevention policies.

this phenomenon will be crucial for buffering agricultural systems from the
effects of climate change. Here, we show that levels of FLM-β, an alternatively
spliced form of the flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS M, increase at lower
temperatures, repressing flowering. FLM-β interacts with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE
(SVP); SVP is degraded at high temperatures, reducing the abundance of the
SVP-FLM-β repressor complex and, thus, allowing the plant to flower. The svp and 
flm mutants show temperature-insensitive flowering in different temperature
ranges. Control of SVP-FLM-β repressor complex abundance via transcriptional and 
splicing regulation of FLM and posttranslational regulation of SVP protein
stability provides an efficient, rapid mechanism for plants to respond to ambient
temperature changes.

Population genetic analysis and origin discrimination of snow crab (Chionoecetes 
opilio) using microsatellite markers.

Kang JH, Park JY, Kim EM, Ko HS.

Major habitats for the snow crab Chionoecetes opilio are mostly found within the 
northwest Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans. However, the East Sea populations of
C. opilio, along with its relative the red snow crab (C. japonicas), are two of
the most important commercial crustacean species for fisheries on the east coast 
of the Korean Peninsula. The East Sea populations of C. opilio are facing
declining resources due to overfishing and global climate change. Thus, an
analysis of population structure is necessary for future management. Five Korean 
and one Russian group of C. opilio were analyzed using nine microsatellite
markers that were recently developed using next-generation sequencing. No linkage
disequilibrium was found between any pair of loci, indicating that the markers
were independent. The number of alleles per locus varied from 4 to 18 with a mean
of 12, and allelic richness per locus ranged from 4.0 to 17.1 across all
populations with a mean of 9.7. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test revealed
significant deviation in three out of nine loci in some populations after
sequential Bonferroni correction and all of them had higher expected
heterozygosity than observed heterozygosity. Null alleles were presumed in four
loci, which explained the homozygosity in three loci. The pairwise fixation index
(F ST ) values among the five Korean snow crab populations did not differ
significantly, but all of the pairwise F ST values between each of the Korean
snow crab populations and the Russian snow crab population differed
significantly. An UPGMA dendrogram revealed clear separation of the Russian snow 
crab population from the Korean snow crab populations. Assignment tests based on 
the allele distribution discriminated between Korean and Russian origins with 93 
% accuracy. Therefore, the snow crab populations around the Korean Peninsula need
to be managed separately from the populations in Bering Sea in global scale
resource management. Also, this information can be used for identification of
snow crab origin which is problematic in worldwide crab trade.

Effects of ocean climate changes on the population structure and abundance of
Pacific saury (Cololabis sira) were investigated on the basis of climate indices,
sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, catch and body size information from the
Tsushima Warm Current (TWC) region (Yellow Sea, East China Sea and East/Japan
Sea) during the period 1950-2010. It is suggested that oceanic regime shifts in
the early 1970s, late 1980s and late 1990s occurred in the TWC region in winter, 
but the regime shifts in the mid-1970s and in the late 1980s were not evident in 
the spring SST anomaly series. The abundance and body size of Pacific saury
fluctuated in association with the winter oceanic changes in the TWC region. The 
catch rates and abundance of large size saury were far bellow average during
their northward migrations in the TWC region in the years with abnormally cool
winters (e.g., 1963, 1970, 1977, 1981-1989 and 2006) and above average in the
years with warm winters. These patterns demonstrate decadal-scale variations
together with large inter-annual fluctuations in the structure and abundance of
Pacific saury in association with the climatic-oceanic changes. These results,
along with an alternation of dominant pelagic fish species, indicate the status
of the saury population in the TWC region is in good condition, similar to that
in the Kuroshio-Oyashio Current (KOC) region during the warm regime after the
late 1980s climate regime shift.

The objective was to quantitatively understand the impacts of climate change (CC)
under the A1B scenario on the contamination levels of 11 polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) from pyrogenic sources in the environmental media based on
model prediction. To predict the impacts of CC in South Korea, a revised version 
of KoEFT-PBTs, a dynamic multimedia model for persistent organic pollutants in
South Korea, was used. Simulations were conducted for the period from 2000 to
2049 under the A1B scenario with the emission data for 2009 and the results for
Seoul and Kangwon were compared to those under no climate change (NCC) scenario. 
Due to CC, the average of annual or monthly average concentration changes within 
a factor of two for the PAHs in air, soil and water. Time dependent comparison
indicates that the maximum increase induced by CC in the monthly average
concentration ranges from 10 to 10(2) in air and water. Change in advective flux 
due to wind speed difference between A1B and NCC dictates the change of the
atmospheric PAHs levels while wet particle deposition due to rain rate difference
contributes to some extent to the change of 5 and 6 ring PAHs. Whether the
concentration change is positive or not depends primarily on the emission
strength of internal sources relative to those in surrounding areas. The CC
induced changes in atmospheric depositions and degradation rate in soil play a
leading role in the change of soil concentration. In water, runoff and
degradation are the key processes to the CC induced concentration change. Both in
soil and water, the relative importance of individual key processes varies with
PAHs. The difference between the two scenarios in wind speed and in rain rate
shows stronger correlations with the concentration change than the temperature
change.

Diverse abiotic and biotic stresses have marked effects on plant growth and
productivity. To combat such stresses, plants have evolved complex but not well
understood responses. Common effects upon perception of environmental stress are 
differential expression of the plant proteome and the synthesis of novel
regulatory proteins for protection from and acclimation to stress conditions.
Plants respond differently in terms of activation of stress-responsive signaling 
pathways depending upon the type and nature of the stresses to which they are
exposed. Progress in proteomics and systems biology approaches has made it
possible to identify the novel proteins and their interactions that function in
abiotic stress responses. This will enable elucidation of the functions of
individual proteins and their roles in signaling networks. Proteomic analysis of 
the responses to various stress conditions is performed most commonly using 2D
gel electrophoresis and high-throughput identification by LC-MS/MS. Because of
recent developments in proteomics techniques, numerous proteomics studies of rice
under abiotic stress conditions have been performed. In this review, proteomics
studies addressing rice responses to the major environmental stresses--including 
cold, heat, drought, salt, heavy metals, minerals, UV radiation, and ozone--are
discussed. Unique or common protein responses to these stress conditions are
summarized and interpreted according to their possible physiological responses in
each stress. Additionally, proteomics studies on various plant systems under
various abiotic stress conditions are compared to provide deeper understanding of
specific and common proteome responses in rice and other plant systems, which
will further contribute to the identification of abiotic stress tolerance factor 
at protein level. Functional analysis of stress-responsive proteins will provide 
new research objectives with the aim of achieving stable crop productivity in the
face of the increasing abiotic stress conditions caused by global climate change.

OBJECTIVES: We previously developed a model for projection of heat-related
mortality attributable to climate change. The objective of this paper is to
improve the fit and precision of and examine the robustness of the model.
METHODS: We obtained daily data for number of deaths and maximum temperature from
respective governmental organizations of Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the USA, and
European countries. For future projection, we used the Bergen climate model 2
(BCM2) general circulation model, the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios
(SRES) A1B socioeconomic scenario, and the mortality projection for the
65+-year-old age group developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). The
heat-related excess mortality was defined as follows: The temperature-mortality
relation forms a V-shaped curve, and the temperature at which mortality becomes
lowest is called the optimum temperature (OT). The difference in mortality
between the OT and a temperature beyond the OT is the excess mortality. To
develop the model for projection, we used Japanese 47-prefecture data from 1972
to 2008. Using a distributed lag nonlinear model (two-dimensional nonparametric
regression of temperature and its lag effect), we included the lag effect of
temperature up to 15 days, and created a risk function curve on which the
projection is based. As an example, we perform a future projection using the
above-mentioned risk function. In the projection, we used 1961-1990 temperature
as the baseline, and temperatures in the 2030s and 2050s were projected using the
BCM2 global circulation model, SRES A1B scenario, and WHO-provided annual
mortality. Here, we used the "counterfactual method" to evaluate the climate
change impact; For example, baseline temperature and 2030 mortality were used to 
determine the baseline excess, and compared with the 2030 excess, for which we
used 2030 temperature and 2030 mortality. In terms of adaptation to warmer
climate, we assumed 0 % adaptation when the OT as of the current climate is used 
and 100 % adaptation when the OT as of the future climate is used. The midpoint
of the OTs of the two types of adaptation was set to be the OT for 50 %
adaptation.
RESULTS: We calculated heat-related excess mortality for 2030 and 2050.
CONCLUSIONS: Our new model is considered to be better fit, and more precise and
robust compared with the previous model.

Production and emission of methane have been increasing concerns due to its
significant effect on global climate change and the carbon cycle. Here we report 
facilitated methane production from acetate by a novel community of methanogens
and acetate oxidizing bacteria in the presence of poorly crystalline akaganeite
slurry. Comparative analyses showed that methanogenesis was significantly
enhanced by added akaganeite and acetate was mostly stoichiometrically converted 
to methane. Electrons produced from anaerobic acetate oxidation are transferred
to akaganeite nanorods that likely prompt the transformation into goethite
nanofibers through a series of biogeochemical processes of soluble Fe(II)
readsorption and Fe(III) reprecipitation. The methanogenic archaea likely harness
the biotransformation of akaganeite to goethite by the Fe(III)-Fe(II) cycle to
facilitate production of methane. These results provide new insights into
biogeochemistry of iron minerals and methanogenesis in the environment, as well
as the development of sustainable methods for microbial methane production.

Seasonal changes in the abundance of exothermic organisms can be expected with
climate change if warmer temperatures can induce changes in their phenology.
Given the increased time for ectothermic organism development at lower
temperatures, we asked whether population dynamics of the house mosquito, Culex
pipiens s.l. (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae), in Jeju-do (South Korea), an island with 
a gradient of warming temperatures from north to south, showed differences in
sensitivity to changes in temperature along the warming gradient. In addition, we
asked whether synchrony, that is, the degree of concerted fluctuations in
mosquito abundance across locations, was affected by the temperature gradient. We
found the association of mosquito abundance with temperature to be delayed by 2
wk in the north when compared with the south. The abundance across all our
sampling locations had a flat synchrony profile that could reflect impacts of
rainfall and average temperature on the average of all our samples. Finally, our 
results showed that population synchrony across space can emerge even when
abundance is differentially impacted by an exogenous factor across an
environmental gradient.

from Jeju Island, South Korea on the potential for Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes
albopictus) influxes and survival from Vietnam rather than Japan.

BACKGROUND: Climate change affects the survival and transmission of arthropod
vectors as well as the development rates of vector-borne pathogens. Increased
international travel is also an important factor in the spread of vector-borne
diseases (VBDs) such as dengue, West Nile, yellow fever, chikungunya, and
malaria. Dengue is the most important vector-borne viral disease. An estimated
2.5 billion people are at risk of infection in the world and there are
approximately 50 million dengue infections and an estimated 500,000 individuals
are hospitalized with dengue haemorrhagic fever annually. The Asian tiger
mosquito (Aedes albopictus) is one of the vectors of dengue virus, and
populations already exist on Jeju Island, South Korea. Currently, colder winter
temperatures kill off Asian tiger mosquito populations and there is no evidence
of the mosquitos being vectors for the dengue virus in this location. However,
dengue virus-bearing mosquito vectors can inflow to Jeju Island from endemic area
such as Vietnam by increased international travel, and this mosquito vector's
survival during colder winter months will likely occur due to the effects of
climate change.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this section, we show the geographical distribution of
medically important mosquito vectors such as Ae. albopictus, a vector of both
dengue and chikungunya viruses; Culex pipiens, a vector of West Nile virus; and
Anopheles sinensis, a vector of Plasmodium vivax, within Jeju Island, South
Korea. We found a significant association between the mean temperature, amount of
precipitation, and density of mosquitoes. The phylogenetic analyses show that an 
Ae. albopictus, collected in southern area of Jeju Island, was identical to
specimens found in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam, and not Nagasaki, Japan.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that mosquito vectors or virus-bearing vectors
can transmit from epidemic regions of Southeast Asia to Jeju Island and can
survive during colder winter months. Therefore, Jeju Island is no longer safe
from vector borne diseases (VBDs) due to the effects of globalization and climate
change, and we should immediately monitor regional climate change to identify
newly emerging VBDs.

A polyindole-reduced graphene oxide (PIG) hybrid was synthesized by reducing
graphene oxide sheets in the presence of polyindole. We have shown PIG as a
material for capturing carbon dioxide (CO2). The PIG hybrid was chemically
activated at temperatures of 400-800 °C, which resulted in nitrogen (N)-doped
graphene sheets. The N-doped graphene sheets are microporous with an adsorption
pore size of 0.6 nm for CO2 and show a maximum (Brunauer, Emmet and Teller)
surface area of 936 m(2) g(-1). The hybrid activated at 600 °C (PIG6) possesses a
surface area of 534 m(2) g(-1) and a micropore volume of 0.29 cm(3) g(-1). PIG6
shows a maximum CO2 adsorption capacity of 3.0 mmol g(-1) at 25 °C and 1 atm.
This high CO2 uptake is due to the highly microporous character of the material
and its N content. The material retains its original adsorption capacity on
recycling even after 10 cycles (within experimental error). PIG6 also shows high 
adsorption selectivity ratios for CO2 over N2, CH4 and H2 of 23, 4 and 85 at 25
°C, respectively.

Temperature affects a cascade of ecological processes and functions of forests.
With future higher global temperatures being inevitable it is critical to
understand and predict how forest ecosystems and tree species will respond. This 
paper reviews experimental warming studies in boreal and temperate forests or
tree species beyond the direct effects of higher temperature on plant
ecophysiology by scaling up to forest level responses and considering the
indirect effects of higher temperature. In direct response to higher temperature 
(1) leaves emerged earlier and senesced later, resulting in a longer growing
season (2) the abundance of herbivorous insects increased and their performance
was enhanced and (3) soil nitrogen mineralization and leaf litter decomposition
were accelerated. Besides these generalizations across species, plant
ecophysiological traits were highly species-specific. Moreover, we showed that
the effect of temperature on photosynthesis is strongly dependent on the position
of the leaf or plant within the forest (canopy or understory) and the time of the
year. Indirect effects of higher temperature included among others higher carbon 
storage in trees due to increased soil nitrogen availability and changes in
insect performance due to alterations in plant ecophysiological traits.
Unfortunately only a few studies extrapolated results to forest ecosystem level
and considered the indirect effects of higher temperature. Thus more intensive,
long-term studies are needed to further confirm the emerging trends shown in this
review. Experimental warming studies provide us with a useful tool to examine the
cascade of ecological processes in forest ecosystems that will change with future
higher temperature.

The warm temperate deciduous forests in Asia have a relatively dense understory, 
hence, it is imperative that we understand the dynamics of transpiration in both 
the overstory (E O) and understory (E U) of forest stands under the influence of 
the Asian monsoon in order to improve the accuracy of forest water use budgeting 
and to identify key factors controlling forest water use under climate change. In
this study, E O and E U of a temperate deciduous forest stand located in South
Korea were measured during the growing season of 2008 using sap flow methods. The
objectives of this study were (1) to quantify the total transpiration of the
forest stand, i.e., overstory and understory, (2) to determine their relative
contribution to ecosystem evapotranspiration (E eco), and (3) to identify factors
controlling the transpiration of each layer. E O and E U were 174 and 22 mm,
respectively. Total transpiration accounted for 55 % of the total E eco,
revealing the importance of unaccounted contributions to E eco (i.e., soil
evaporation and wet canopy evaporation). During the monsoon period, there was a
strong reduction in the total transpiration, likely because of reductions in
photosynthetic active radiation, vapor pressure deficit and plant area index. The
ratio of E U to E O declined during the same period, indicating an effect of
monsoon on the partitioning of E eco in its two components. The seasonal pattern 
of E O was synchronized with the overstory canopy development, which equally had 
a strong regulatory influence on E U.

OBJECTIVES: The mass media play a crucial role in risk communication regarding
climate change. The aim of this study was to investigate the trend in
journalistic reports on climate change in the daily newspapers of Korea.
METHODS: We selected 9 daily newspapers in Korea, which according to the ABC
Association, represented 77% of newspaper circulation, out of a total of 44
Korean daily newspapers. The collected articles were from 2009 to 2011. All of
the articles were sorted into the following 8 categories: greenhouse gas, climate
change conventions, sea level rise, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
synthesis reports, expected damage and effect, use of fossil fuels, global
warming, and mitigation or adaptation. A chi-squared test was done on the
articles, which were counted and classified into cause, effect, and measurement
of climate change according to the newspaper's majority or minority ownership
structure.
RESULTS: From the 9 selected newspapers, the number of articles on climate change
by month was greatest in December 2009. Generally, the articles vague about
climate change (lack of precise data, negative or skeptical tone, and improper
use of terminology) were much more common than the articles presenting accurate
knowledge. A statistical difference was found based on ownership structure: the
majority-owned newspapers addressed the cause of climate change, while the
minority-owned newspapers referred more to climate change measurement.
CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation revealed that generally Korean daily newspapers
did not deliver accurate information about climate change. The coverage of the
newspapers showed significant differences according to the ownership structure.

This study examined the separate and combined impacts of future changes in
climate and land use/land cover (LULC) on streamflow in the Hoeya River Basin,
South Korea, using the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5
scenarios of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC). First, a LULC change model was developed using RCP 4.5 and
RCP 8.5 storylines and logistic regression. Three scenarios (climate change only,
LULC change only, and climate and LULC change combined) were established, and the
streamflow in future periods under these scenarios was simulated by the Soil and 
Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Each scenario showed distinct seasonal
variations in streamflow. Under climate change only, streamflow increased in
spring and winter but decreased in summer and autumn, whereas LULC change
increased high flow during wet periods but decreased low flow in dry periods.
Although the LULC change had less effect than climate change on the changes in
streamflow, the effect of LULC change on streamflow was significant. The result
for the combined scenario was similar to that of the climate change only
scenario, but with larger seasonal changes in streamflow. Although the effects of
LULC change were smaller than those caused by climate change, LULC changes may
heighten the problems of increased seasonal variability in streamflow caused by
climate change. The results obtained in this study provide further insight into
the availability of future streamflow and can aid in water resource management
planning in the study area.

Here, we experimentally examined how an episodic lack of sunshine (ELS), as an
extreme weather event, would affect rice productivity under warming with elevated
[CO2 ]. In 2009 and 2010, rice plants were grown at two levels of [CO2 ] (ca. 390
and 650 μl l(-1) ) and three levels of warming (≈ambient, +1.2 °C, and +2.2/2.4
°C) in six independent temperature gradient field chambers (three each for
ambient and elevated [CO2 ]). At panicle initiation (PI), booting (BT), or
flowering (FL), rice plants were exposed to ELS (ca. 18% of full sunlight) for
10-14 days consecutively. As expected, ELS elicited a significant reduction in
aboveground biomass (AGB) and yields. However, elevated [CO2 ] had the potential 
to relieve the ELS-induced reduction in AGB and yield, whereas warming had the
reverse effect for yields, without a significant warming × [CO2 ] interaction.
When ELS applied at PI, BT, and FL, the extents to which warming-reduced yields
(averaged across [CO2 ] levels) ranged from 9 to 25%, 7 to 14, and 10 to 18% at
+1.2 °C, and ranged from 24 to 56%, 22 to 55%, and 18 to 46% at +2.2/2.4 °C
across two seasons, respectively. Meanwhile, under normal sunshine they ranged
from 1 to 3% at +1.2 °C and 7 to 21% at +2.2/2.4 °C. Warming predisposed rice
plants that had experienced ELS to be more sensitive to spikelet sterility and
spikelet number per panicle, accounting for most of the yield reductions. These
findings provide evidence that an expected warming could further exacerbate rice 
productivity if ELS occurs simultaneously during reproductive stages. Our results
collectively suggest that it might be critically important to consider extreme
events for a holistic evaluation of the potential impact of warming and [CO2 ] on
crop productivity, when considering changing climate.

The crop simulation model is a suitable tool for evaluating the potential impacts
of climate change on crop production and on the environment. This study
investigates the effects of climate change on paddy rice production in the
temperate climate regions under the East Asian monsoon system using the
CERES-Rice 4.0 crop simulation model. This model was first calibrated and
validated for crop production under elevated CO2 and various temperature
conditions. Data were obtained from experiments performed using a temperature
gradient field chamber (TGFC) with a CO2 enrichment system installed at Chonnam
National University in Gwangju, Korea in 2009 and 2010. Based on the empirical
calibration and validation, the model was applied to deliver a simulated forecast
of paddy rice production for the region, as well as for the other Japonica rice
growing regions in East Asia, projecting for years 2050 and 2100. In these
climate change projection simulations in Gwangju, Korea, the yield increases
(+12.6 and + 22.0%) due to CO2 elevation were adjusted according to temperature
increases showing variation dependent upon the cultivars, which resulted in
significant yield decreases (-22.1% and -35.0%). The projected yields were
determined to increase as latitude increases due to reduced temperature effects, 
showing the highest increase for any of the study locations (+24%) in Harbin,
China. It appears that the potential negative impact on crop production may be
mediated by appropriate cultivar selection and cultivation changes such as
alteration of the planting date. Results reported in this study using the
CERES-Rice 4.0 model demonstrate the promising potential for its further
application in simulating the impacts of climate change on rice production from a
local to a regional scale under the monsoon climate system.

Plasmodium vivax was endemic in temperate areas in historic times up to the
middle of last century. Temperate climate P. vivax has a long incubation time of 
up to 8-10 months, which partly explain how it can be endemic in temperate areas 
with a could winter. P. vivax disappeared from Europe within the last 40-60
years, and this change was not related to climatic changes. The surge of P. vivax
in Northern Europe after the second world war was related to displacement of
refugees and large movement of military personnel exposed to malaria. Lately P.
vivax has been seen along the demilitarized zone in South Korea replication a
high endemicity in North Korea. The potential of transmission of P. vivax still
exist in temperate zones, but reintroduction in a larger scale of P. vivax to
areas without present transmission require large population movements of P. vivax
infected people. The highest threat at present is refugees from P. vivax endemic 
North Korea entering China and South Korea in large numbers.

Carbon dioxide is a small, relatively inert, but highly volatile gas that not
only gives beer its bubbles, but that also acts as one of the primary driving
forces of anthropogenic climate change. While beer brewers experiment with the
effects of CO2 on flavor and climate scientists are concerned with global changes
to ambient CO2 levels that take place over the course of decades, many animal
species are keenly aware of changes in CO2 concentration that occur much more
rapidly and on a much more local scale. Although imperceptible to us, these small
changes in CO2 concentration can indicate imminent danger, signal overcrowding,
and point the way to food. Here I review several of these CO2-evoked behaviors
and compare the systems insects, nematodes, and vertebrates use to detect
environmental CO2.

This study makes use of this distinction to analyze the exhaust gas concentration
and fuel of the circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler that mainly uses wood
biomass, and to develop the emission factors of Methane (CH(4)), Nitrous oxide
(N(2)O). The fuels used as energy sources in the subject working sites are Wood
Chip Fuel (WCF), RDF and Refused Plastic Fuel (RPF) of which heating values are
11.9 TJ/Gg, 17.1 TJ/Gg, and 31.2 TJ/Gg, respectively. The average concentrations 
of CH(4) and N(2)O were measured to be 2.78 ppm and 7.68 ppm, respectively. The
analyzed values and data collected from the field survey were used to calculate
the emission factor of CH(4) and N(2)O exhausted from the CFB boiler. As a
result, the emission factors of CH(4) and N(2)O are 1.4 kg/TJ (0.9-1.9 kg/TJ) and
4.0 kg/TJ (2.9-5.3 kg/TJ) within a 95% confidence interval. Biomass combined with
the combustion technology for the CFB boiler proved to be more effective in
reducing the N(2)O emission, compared to the emission factor of the CFB boiler
using fossil fuel.

Recently, amphibians and reptiles have drawn attention because of declines in
species and populations caused mainly by habitat loss, overexploitation and
climate change. This study constructed a DNA barcode database for the Korean
herpetofauna, including all the recorded amphibians and 68% of the recorded
reptiles, to provide a useful, standardized tool for species identification in
monitoring and management. A total of 103 individuals from 18 amphibian and 17
reptile species were used to generate barcode sequences using partial sequences
of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and to compare it 
with other suggested barcode loci. Comparing 16S rRNA, cytochrome b (Cytb) and
COI for amphibians and 12S rRNA, Cytb and COI for reptiles, our results revealed 
that COI is better than the other markers in terms of a high level of sequence
variation without length variation and moderate amplification success. Although
the COI marker had no clear barcoding gap because of the high level of
intraspecific variation, all of the analysed individuals from the same species
clustered together in a neighbour-joining tree. High intraspecific variation
suggests the possibility of cryptic species. Finally, using this database,
confiscated snakes were identified as Elaphe schrenckii, designated as endangered
in Korea and a food contaminant was identified as the lizard Takydromus
amurensis.

Powdery mildew diseases are sensitive to climate change and spread can be favored
by increased temperature and low moisture. During 2011 to 2012, a powdery mildew 
disease by a Podosphaera species was observed on the leaves of Japanese thistle
(Cirsium japonicum) in Korea. The initial sign of this disease included scattered
superficial white mycelia on leaves. As the disease progressed, abundant necrotic
black spots exhibiting chasmothecia were formed on the leaves. rDNA ITS and 28S
homologies of the fungus (EML-CSPW1) showed 100% identity values with those
regions from many strains of P. xanthii (syn. P. fusca) via NCBI BLASTN search.

Policy Directions Addressing the Public Health Impact of Climate Change in South 
Korea: The Climate-change Health Adaptation and Mitigation Program.

Shin YS(1), Ha J.

Author information:

Climate change, caused by global warming, is increasingly recognized as a major
threat to mankind's survival. Climate change concurrently has both direct and
modifying influences on environmental, social, and public health systems
undermining human health as a whole. Environmental health policy-makers need to
make use of political and technological alternatives to address these ramifying
effects. The objective of this paper is to review public health policy in Korea, 
as well as internationally, particularly as it relates to climate change health
adaptation and mitigation programs (such as C-CHAMP of Korea), in order to assess
and elicit directions for a robust environmental health policy that is adaptive
to the health impacts of climate change. In Korea, comprehensive measures to
prevent or mitigate overall health effects are limited, and the diffusion of
responsibility among various government departments makes consistency in policy
execution very difficult. This paper proposes integration, synergy, and
utilization as the three core principles of policy direction for the assessment
and adaptation to the health impacts of climate change. For specific action
plans, we suggest policy making based on scientifically integrated health impact 
assessments and the prioritization of environmental factors in climate change;
the development of practical and technological tools that support policy
decisions by making their political implementation more efficient; and customized
policy development that deals with the vulnerability of local communities.

Colliding fragment islands transport independent lineages of endemic
rock-crawlers (Grylloblattodea: Grylloblattidae) in the Japanese archipelago.

Fragment islands, viewed from the paradigm of island biogeographic theory, depend
on continual immigration from continental sources to maintain levels of species
diversity, or otherwise undergo a period of relaxation where species diversity
declines to a lower equilibrium. Japan is a recently derived fragment island with
a rich endemic flora and fauna. These endemic species have been described as
paleoendemics, and conversely as recently derived Pleistocene colonists.
Geological events in the Miocene period, notably the fragmentation and collision 
of islands, and the subsequent uplift of mountains in central Japan, provided
opportunities for genetic isolation. More recently, cyclical climatic change
during the Pliocene and Pleistocene periods led to intermittent land bridge
connections to continental Asia. Here we investigate the pattern and timing of
diversification in a diverse endemic lineage in order to test whether ongoing
migration has sustained species diversity, whether there is evidence of
relaxation, and how geological and climatic events are associated with lineage
diversification. Using multi-locus genetic data, we test these hypotheses in a
poorly dispersing, cold-adapted terrestrial insect lineage (Grylloblattodea:
Grylloblattidae) sampled from Japan, Korea, and Russia. In phylogenetic analyses 
of concatenated data and a species tree approach, we find evidence of three
deeply divergent lineages of rock-crawlers in Japan consistent with the pattern
of island fragmentation from continental Asia. Tests of lineage diversification
rates suggest that relaxation has not occurred and instead endemism has increased
in the Japanese Grylloblattidae following mountain-building events in the
Miocene. Although the importance of climate change in generating species
diversity is a commonly held paradigm in Japanese biogeography, our analyses,
including analyses of demographic change and phylogeographic range shifts in
putative species, suggests that Pleistocene climatic change has had a limited
effect on the diversification of rock-crawlers.

Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from livestock agriculture in 16 local
administrative districts of Korea.

Ji ES, Park KH.

This study was conducted to evaluate methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)
emissions from livestock agriculture in 16 local administrative districts of
Korea from 1990 to 2030. National Inventory Report used 3 yr averaged livestock
population but this study used 1 yr livestock population to find yearly emission 
fluctuations. Extrapolation of the livestock population from 1990 to 2009 was
used to forecast future livestock population from 2010 to 2030. Past (yr 1990 to 
2009) and forecasted (yr 2010 to 2030) averaged enteric CH4 emissions and CH4 and
N2O emissions from manure treatment were estimated. In the section of enteric
fermentation, forecasted average CH4 emissions from 16 local administrative
districts were estimated to increase by 4%-114% compared to that of the past
except for Daejeon (-63%), Seoul (-36%) and Gyeonggi (-7%). As for manure
treatment, forecasted average CH4 emissions from the 16 local administrative
districts were estimated to increase by 3%-124% compared to past average except
for Daejeon (-77%), Busan (-60%), Gwangju (-48%) and Seoul (-8%). For manure
treatment, forecasted average N2O emissions from the 16 local administrative
districts were estimated to increase by 10%-153% compared to past average CH4
emissions except for Daejeon (-60%), Seoul (-4.0%), and Gwangju (-0.2%). With the
carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (CO2-Eq), forecasted average CO2-Eq from the 
16 local administrative districts were estimated to increase by 31%-120% compared
to past average CH4 emissions except Daejeon (-65%), Seoul (-24%), Busan (-18%), 
Gwangju (-8%) and Gyeonggi (-1%). The decreased CO2-Eq from 5 local
administrative districts was only 34 kt, which was insignificantly small compared
to increase of 2,809 kt from other 11 local administrative districts. Annual
growth rates of enteric CH4 emissions, CH4 and N2O emissions from manure
management in Korea from 1990 to 2009 were 1.7%, 2.6%, and 3.2%, respectively.
The annual growth rate of total CO2-Eq was 2.2%. Efforts by the local
administrative offices to improve the accuracy of activity data are essential to 
improve GHG inventories. Direct measurements of GHG emissions from enteric
fermentation and manure treatment systems will further enhance the accuracy of
the GHG data. (Key Words: Greenhouse Gas, Methane, Nitrous Oxide, Carbon Dioxide 
Equivalent Emission, Climate Change).

Fungal ball in paranasal sinus was reported to be rare, but these days we have
encountered numerous cases. We retrospectively analyzed the data of 4,485
patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) who underwent sinus surgery from 1999 
to 2010. Patients were categorized into group A (patients from 1999 to 2004) and 
group B (patients from 2005 to 2010). We compared the prevalence and clinical
aspects of fungal ball between the two groups by analyzing the medical records,
PNS CT findings, surgical findings, and pathologic reports. One hundred and
twelve patients were diagnosed with fungal ball during the study periods. The
prevalence of fungal ball was 0.9 % (23/2,333) in group A and 4.1 % (89/2,152) in
group B, showing that it increased 4.6 times over 6 years. The prevalence of
underlying diseases was 21.7 % (5/23) for hypertension and 8.7 % (2/23) for
diabetes in group A, and 23.6 % (21/89) for hypertension and 14.6 % (13/89) for
diabetes in group B. On PNS CT examination, calcification was identified in 78.2 
% (18/23) of cases in group A and 44.9 % (40/89) in group B. The most involved
paranasal sinus in group A was the co-involved maxillary and ethmoid sinuses at
26.1 % (6/23), whereas, the most prevalent involved sinus in group B was the
maxillary sinus at 33.7 % (30/89). We found that the prevalence of fungal ball
has increased steadily each year since 2005, accompanied by changes in the
clinical aspects. These facts should be kept in mind when diagnosing and treating
patients with medically intractable CRS.

Although most enterovirus infections are not serious enough to be life
threatening, several enteroviruses such as enterovirus 71 are responsible for
severe, potentially life-threatening disease. The epidemic patterns of
enteroviruses occur regularly during the year, but they may change due to
environmental shifts induced by climate change due to global warming. Therefore, 
enterovirus epidemiological studies should be performed continuously as a basis
for anti-viral studies. A great number of synthesized antiviral compounds that
work against enteroviruses have been developed but only a few have demonstrated
effectiveness in vivo. No proven effective antiviral agents are available for
enterovirus disease therapy. The development of a new antiviral drug is a
difficult task due to poor selective toxicity and cost. To overcome these
limitations, one approach is to accelerate the availability of other existing
antiviral drugs approved for antiviral effect against enteroviruses, and the
other way is to screen traditional medicinal plants.

Enhanced butanol production obtained by reinforcing the direct butanol-forming
route in Clostridium acetobutylicum.

Butanol is an important industrial solvent and advanced biofuel that can be
produced by biphasic fermentation by Clostridium acetobutylicum. It has been
known that acetate and butyrate first formed during the acidogenic phase are
reassimilated to form acetone-butanol-ethanol (cold channel). Butanol can also be
formed directly from acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) through butyryl-CoA (hot channel).
However, little is known about the relative contributions of the two
butanol-forming pathways. Here we report that the direct butanol-forming pathway 
is a better channel to optimize for butanol production through metabolic flux and
mass balance analyses. Butanol production through the hot channel was maximized
by simultaneous disruption of the pta and buk genes, encoding
phosphotransacetylase and butyrate kinase, while the adhE1(D485G) gene, encoding 
a mutated aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase, was overexpressed. The ratio of butanol
produced through the hot channel to that produced through the cold channel
increased from 2.0 in the wild type to 18.8 in the engineered BEKW(pPthlAAD(**)) 
strain. By reinforcing the direct butanol-forming flux in C. acetobutylicum, 18.9
g/liter of butanol was produced, with a yield of 0.71 mol butanol/mol glucose by 
batch fermentation, levels which are 160% and 245% higher than those obtained
with the wild type. By fed-batch culture of this engineered strain with in situ
recovery, 585.3 g of butanol was produced from 1,861.9 g of glucose, with the
yield of 0.76 mol butanol/mol glucose and productivity of 1.32 g/liter/h. Studies
of two butanol-forming routes and their effects on butanol production in C.
acetobutylicum described here will serve as a basis for further metabolic
engineering of clostridia aimed toward developing a superior butanol producer.
IMPORTANCE Renewable biofuel is one of the answers to solving the energy crisis
and climate change problems. Butanol produced naturally by clostridia has
superior liquid fuel characteristics and thus has the potential to replace
gasoline. Due to the lack of efficient genetic manipulation tools, however,
strain improvement has been rather slow. Furthermore, complex metabolic
characteristics of acidogenesis followed by solventogenesis in this strain have
hampered development of engineered clostridia having highly efficient and
selective butanol production capability. Here we report for the first time the
results of systems metabolic engineering studies of two butanol-forming routes
and their relative importances in butanol production. Based on these findings, a 
metabolically engineered Clostridium acetobutylicum strain capable of producing
butanol to a high titer with high yield and selectivity could be developed by
reinforcing the direct butanol-forming flux.

The simple proton-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase (H(+)-PPase) found in
plants and protists is an evolutionally conserved, essential enzyme that
catalyzes the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate (PPi). Little is known about the
functional contribution of H(+)-PPase to the cellular response to abiotic
stresses, except its high salinity and drought stress. To investigate the role of
H(+)-PPase during response to cellular stress, we isolated the cDNA of
Arabidopsis thaliana H(+)-PPase (AVP1) and Oryza sativa H(+)-PPase (OVP1) and
constructed transgenic Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli lines that
express AVP1 and OVP1. In S. cerevisiae, the expression of a chimeric derivative 
of the AVP1 and OVP1 alleviated the phenotype associated with ipp2-deficient
cells in the presence of high salinity (NaCl) and metal stressors (Cd, Mn, and
Zn). In E. coli, AVP1 and OVP1 overexpression conferred enhanced tolerance to
abiotic stresses, including heat shock and H(2)O(2), as well as NaCl, Cd, Mn, Zn,
Ca, and Al. Interestingly, AVP1 and OVP1 overexpression resulted in
hypersensitivity to menadione and cobalt. These results demonstrate the cellular 
capacity of AVP1- and OVP1-expressing transgenic yeast and E. coli in response to
physiological, abiotic stresses. Moreover, our results suggest new ways of
engineering stress-tolerant plants that are capable of responding to climate
change. Here, we provide an outline of an experimental system to examine the
alternative roles of plant H(+)-PPase.

Climate change offers serious challenges to the effectiveness of science,
communication, and community. It demands us to look back upon what we have done
in regard to science and technology. In addition, it leads us to examine human
efforts invested to solve collective, shared problems by communication and
community. The process of behavior per se is found to be greatly overlooked in
the establishment sciences, both natural and social, and in both theory and
practice. A theory of behavior is introduced and explicated as a platform to
solve such commons' problems as climate change. Finally, we find principled ways 
to improve effectiveness of communication and community by developing human
capabilities so that we can win our battle against climate change and other
potential tragedies of the commons.

BACKGROUND: Injuries are affected by weather conditions, which influence various 
human activities. However, only a few studies have reported an association
between injuries and weather conditions despite the fact that extreme weather
conditions can occur more frequently with climate change. The goal of this study 
was to evaluate the association between outdoor temperature and traumatic and
nontraumatic injury using emergency ambulance delivery.
METHODS: We designed a prognostic study to evaluate the different effects of
outdoor temperature depending on types of injury. Using a generalized additive
model, we examined the association between outdoor temperatures and injuries in
Korea from 2006 to 2008, adjusting for confounders such as relative humidity, day
of the week, and long-term time trends. A random effects model was used to
estimate combined effects across all areas.
RESULTS: The city-combined effect estimate for nontraumatic injuries was 1.95%
(95% confidence interval, 1.28-2.62%) corresponding to a 1°C increase in mean
temperature, whereas the relationship for traumatic injuries was not linear. The 
risk of nontraumatic injury related to temperature for males and elderly
individuals was higher than for females and younger people.
CONCLUSION: The risk of injury attributable to outdoor temperature was found to
vary according to the injury type. This information may be useful for developing 
adaptation strategies related to climate change.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic study, level III.

and nitrous oxide from combined-cycle power plant in Korea.

In this research, in order to develop technology/country-specific emission
factors of methane (CH(4)) and nitrous oxide (N(2)O), a total of 585 samples from
eight gas-fired turbine combined cycle (GTCC) power plants were measured and
analyzed. The research found that the emission factor for CH(4) stood at "0.82
kg/TJ", which was an 18 % lower than the emission factor for liquefied natural
gas (LNG) GTCC "1 kg/TJ" presented by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC). The result was 8 % up when compared with the emission factor of Japan
which stands at "0.75 kg/TJ". The emission factor for N(2)O was "0.65 kg/TJ",
which is significantly lower than "3 kg/TJ" of the emission factor for LNG GTCC
presented by IPCC, but over six times higher than the default N(2)O emission
factor of LNG. The evaluation of uncertainty was conducted based on the estimated
non-CO(2) emission factors, and the ranges of uncertainty for CH(4) and N(2)O
were between -12.96 and +13.89 %, and -11.43 and +12.86 %, respectively, which is
significantly lower than uncertainties presented by IPCC. These differences
proved that non-CO(2) emissions can change depending on combustion technologies; 
therefore, it is vital to establish country/technology-specific emission factors.

The concentrations of isoflavones and anthocyanins in five soybean seed cultivars
of three different planting dates were determined in this study. Among the seeds 
of three different planting dates, the highest concentration of average total
isoflavones (4098 μg g(-1)) was measured in those from early July, whereas the
lowest concentration of average total isoflavones (3238 μg g(-1)) was measured in
those from late May. Anthocyanin compounds were detected only in the Cheongjakong
3 cultivar. Among the three different planting dates, late-planted Cheongjakong 3
accumulated the highest concentration of total anthocyanins (10103 μg g(-1)),
whereas the variety at an earlier planting date exhibited the lowest
concentration of average total anthocyanins (7115 μg g(-1)). On the basis of
these results, it was concluded that environmental factors such as temperature
and precipitation may change the isoflavone and anthocyanin contents of soybean, 
altering the nutritional values of soy products.

tundra soils.

Tundra ecosystem is of importance for its high accumulation of organic carbon and
vulnerability to future climate change. Microorganisms play a key role in carbon 
dynamics of the tundra ecosystem by mineralizing organic carbon. We assessed both
ecosystem process rates and community structure of Bacteria, Archaea, and Fungi
in different soil layers (surface organic layer and subsurface mineral soil) in
an Arctic soil ecosystem located at Spitsbergen, Svalbard during the summer of
2008 by using biochemical and molecular analyses, such as enzymatic assay,
terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and pyrosequencing. Activity of hydrolytic
enzymes showed difference according to soil type. For all three microbial
communities, the average gene copy number did not significantly differ between
soil types. However, archaeal diversities appeared to differ according to soil
type, whereas bacterial and fungal diversity indices did not show any variation. 
Correlation analysis between biogeochemical and microbial parameters exhibited a 
discriminating pattern according to microbial or soil types. Analysis of the
microbial community structure showed that bacterial and archaeal communities have
different profiles with unique phylotypes in terms of soil types. Water content
and hydrolytic enzymes were found to be related with the structure of bacterial
and archaeal communities, whereas soil organic matter (SOM) and total organic
carbon (TOC) were related with bacterial communities. The overall results of this
study indicate that microbial enzyme activity were generally higher in the
organic layer than in mineral soils and that bacterial and archaeal communities
differed between the organic layer and mineral soils in the Arctic region.
Compared to mineral soil, peat-covered organic layer may represent a hotspot for 
secondary productivity and nutrient cycling in this ecosystem.

Diatom fossils from core sediments and living diatoms from water samples of
Notoro Lagoon in northern Japan were examined to evaluate natural climate effects
on lagoon environmental changes. In 1974, the artificial inlet was excavated.
Immediately after, the anoxic bottom water in Notoro Lagoon began to disappear
due to an increasing water exchange rate. However, chemical oxygen demand (COD)
in the bottom water of Notoro Lagoon gradually increased, with fluctuations,
during the last 30 years. In addition, the dominant diatom assemblages in Notoro 
Lagoon shifted to ice-related and spring bloom taxa after the excavation. The
dominant taxa of each year in the sediment core were also strongly related to the
timing of lagoon ice melting. This is because the COD in Notoro Lagoon was
affected by the deposited volume of blooming diatoms, which was controlled by the
duration of ice cover and the timing of ice discharge to the Okhotsk Sea likely
due to an air pressure pattern change over the northern North Pacific like the
Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).

temperature-controlled conditions from soil.

In an effort to study the possible effects of climate change on the behavior of
atmospheric mercury (Hg), we built a temperature-controlled microchamber system
to measure its emission from top soils. To this end, mercury vapour emission
rates were investigated in the laboratory using top soil samples collected from
an urban area. The emissions of Hg, when measured as a function of soil
temperature (from ambient levels up to 70°C at increments of 10°C), showed a
positive correlation with rising temperature. According to the continuous
analyses of the Hg vapor given off by the identical soil samples, evasion rate
diminished noticeably with increasing number of repetitions. The experimental
results, if examined in terms of activation energy (Ea), showed highly
contrasting patterns between the single and repetitive runs. Although the results
of the former exhibited Ea values smaller than the vaporization energy of Hg
(i.e., <14 Kcal mol(-1)), those of the latter increased systematically with
increasing number of repetitions. As such, it is proposed that changes in the
magnitude of Ea values can be used as a highly sensitive criterion to
discriminate the important role of vaporization from other diverse
(biotic/abiotic) processes occurring in the soil layer.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the acute effects of heat stress on body
temperature and blood pressure of elderly individuals living in poor housing
conditions.
METHODS: Repeated measurements of the indoor temperature, relative humidity, body
temperature, and blood pressure were conducted for 20 elderly individuals living 
in low-cost dosshouses in Seoul during hot summer days in 2010. Changes in the
body temperature, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure
(DBP) according to variations in the indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity 
were analyzed using a repeated-measures ANOVA controlling for age, sex, alcohol, 
and smoking.
RESULTS: Average indoor and outdoor temperatures were 31.47℃ (standard deviation 
[SD], 0.97℃) and 28.15℃ (SD, 2.03℃), respectively. Body temperature increased by 
0.21℃ (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16 to 0.26℃) and 0.07℃ (95% CI, 0.04 to
0.10℃) with an increase in the indoor and outdoor temperature of 1℃. DBP
decreased by 2.05 mmHg (95% CI, 0.05 to 4.05 mmHg), showing a statistical
significance, as the indoor temperature increased by 1℃, while it increased by
0.20 mmHg (95% CI, -0.83 to 1.22 mmHg) as outdoor temperature increased by 1℃.
SBP decreased by 1.75 mmHg (95% CI, -1.11 to 4.61 mmHg) and 0.35 mmHg (95% CI,
-1.04 to 1.73 mmHg), as the indoor and outdoor temperature increased by 1℃,
respectively. The effects of relative humidity on SBP and DBP were not
statistically significant for both indoor and outdoor.
CONCLUSIONS: The poor and elderly are directly exposed to heat waves, while their
vital signs respond sensitively to increase in temperature. Careful adaptation
strategies to climate change considering socioeconomic status are therefore
necessary.

Bovine carbonic anhydrase (BCA) was covalently immobilized onto OAPS
(octa(aminophenyl)silsesquioxane)-functionalized Fe(3)O(4)/SiO(2) nanoparticles
by using glutaraldehyde as a spacer. The Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles were coated with
SiO(2), onto which was grafted OAPS, and the product was characterized using SEM,
TEM, XRD, IR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and magnetometer analysis. 
The enzymatic activities of the free and Fe(3)O(4)/SiO(2)/OAPS-conjugated BCA
(Fe-CA) were investigated by hydrolyzing p-nitrophenylacetate (p-NPA), and
hydration and sequestration of CO(2) to CaCO(3). The CO(2) conversion efficiency 
and reusability of the Fe-CA were studied before and after washing the recovered 
Fe-CA by applying a magnetic field and quantifying the unreacted Ca(2+) ions by
using ion chromatography. After 30 cycles, the Fe-CA displayed strong activity,
and the CO(2) capture efficiency was 26-fold higher than that of the free enzyme.
Storage stability studies suggested that Fe-CA retained nearly 82 % of its
activity after 30 days. Nucleation of the precipitated CaCO(3) was monitored by
using polarized light microscopy, which revealed the formation of two phases,
calcite and valerite, at pH 10 upon addition of serine. The magnetic
nanobiocatalyst was shown to be an excellent reusable catalyst for the
sequestration of CO(2).

Changes in the association between summer temperature and mortality in Seoul,
South Korea.

The health impact of climate change depends on various conditions at any given
time and place, as well as on the person. Temporal variations in the relationship
between high temperature and mortality need to be explored in depth to explain
how changes in the level of exposure and public health interventions modify the
temperature-mortality relationship. We examined changes in the relationship
between human mortality and temperature in Seoul, which has the highest
population in South Korea, considering the change in population structure from
1993-2009. Poisson regression models were used to estimate short-term
temperature-related mortality impacts. Temperature-related risks were divided
into two "time periods" of approximately equal length (1993 and 1995-2000, and
2001-2009), and were also examined according to early summer and late summer.
Temperature-related mortality in summer over the past 17 years has declined.
These decreasing patterns were stronger for cardiovascular disease-related
mortality than for all non-accidental deaths. The novel finding is that declines 
in temperature-related mortality were particularly noteworthy in late summer. Our
results indicate that temperature-related mortality is decreasing in Seoul,
particularly during late summer and, to a lesser extent, during early summer.
This information would be useful for detailed public health preparedness for hot 
weather.

Copepods are the most abundant multicellular animal group and are often most
important component of zooplankton and indicators of local and global climate
change. Among this broad group of animals, Calanus sinicus holds an important
role in the ecosystems of The East China Sea, The Korea Strait, and The East Sea.
By comparing the response of their proteomes to ecologically viable environment
changes, this study tried to identify molecular responses accountable for
compensation of a change in metabolic rates. Using two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis and mass spectrometry on C. sinicus sampled at its native
environment, 45 distinct proteins were identified that changed abundance as a
function of environment changes i.e., temperature elevation and/or oxygen
decrease, and 14 that are only present in proteome adapted to higher
temperature/lower oxygen. Although the study failed to find heat shock proteins, 
the abundance of disulfide-isomerase A3 precursor was higher in species thriving 
at higher temperatures/lower oxygen. The abundance of proteins responsible for
redox homeostasis, DNA maintenance, and chromatin rearrangement was also higher
at elevated temperature. Also, the molecular machinery responsible for xenobiotic
metabolism is mobilized at higher temperatures/ lower oxygen levels. These data
indicate fine adjustment of molecular apparatus in response to changes in living 
environment.

Carbonaceous aerosols (CA) emitted by fossil and biomass fuels consist of black
carbon (BC), a strong absorber of solar radiation, and organic matter (OM). OM
scatters as well as absorbs solar radiation. The absorbing component of OM, which
is ignored in most climate models, is referred to as brown carbon (BrC). Model
estimates of the global CA radiative forcing range from 0 to 0.7 Wm(-2), to be
compared with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's estimate for the
pre-Industrial to the present net radiative forcing of about 1.6 Wm(-2). This
study provides a model-independent, observationally based estimate of the CA
direct radiative forcing. Ground-based aerosol network data is integrated with
field data and satellite-based aerosol observations to provide a decadal (2001
through 2009) global view of the CA optical properties and direct radiative
forcing. The estimated global CA direct radiative effect is about 0.75 Wm(-2)
(0.5 to 1.0). This study identifies the global importance of BrC, which is shown 
to contribute about 20% to 550-nm CA solar absorption globally. Because of the
inclusion of BrC, the net effect of OM is close to zero and the CA forcing is
nearly equal to that of BC. The CA direct radiative forcing is estimated to be
about 0.65 (0.5 to about 0.8) Wm(-2), thus comparable to or exceeding that by
methane. Caused in part by BrC absorption, CAs have a net warming effect even
over open biomass-burning regions in Africa and the Amazon.

Biochar application to soil has drawn much attention as a strategy to sequester
atmospheric carbon in soil ecosystems. The applicability of this strategy as a
climate change mitigation option is limited by our understanding of the
mechanisms responsible for the observed changes in greenhouse gas emissions from 
soils, microbial responses, and soil fertility changes. We conducted an 8-wk
laboratory incubation using soils from PASTURE (silt loam) and RICE PADDY (silt
loam) sites with and without two types of biochar (biochar from swine manure
[CHAR-M] and from barley stover [CHAR-B]). Responses to addition of the different
biochars varied with the soil source. Addition of CHAR-B did not change CO and CH
evolution from the PASTURE or the RICE PADDY soils, but there was a decrease in
NO emissions from the PASTURE soil. The effects of CHAR-M addition on greenhouse 
gas emissions were different for the soils. The most substantial change was an
increase in NO emissions from the RICE PADDY soil. This result was attributed to 
a combination of abundant denitrifiers in this soil and increased net nitrogen
mineralization. Soil phosphatase and N-acetylglucosaminidase activity in the
CHAR-B-treated soils was enhanced compared with the controls for both soils.
Fungal biomass was higher in the CHAR-B-treated RICE PADDY soil. From our
results, we suggest CHAR-B to be an appropriate amendment for the PASTURE and
RICE PADDY soils because it provides increased nitrogen availability and
microbial activity with no net increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Application 
of CHAR-M to RICE PADDY soils could result in excess nitrogen availability, which
may increase NO emissions and possible NO leaching problems. Thus, this study
confirms that the ability of environmentally sound biochar additions to sequester
carbon in soils depends on the characteristics of the receiving soil as well as
the nature of the biochar.

BACKGROUND: Climate change may affect Plasmodium vivax malaria transmission in a 
wide region including both subtropical and temperate areas.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to estimate the effects of climatic variables on the
transmission of P. vivax in temperate regions.
METHODS: We estimated the effects of climatic factors on P. vivax malaria
transmission using data on weekly numbers of malaria cases for the years
2001-2009 in the Republic of Korea. Generalized linear Poisson models and
distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNM) were adopted to estimate the effects of
temperature, relative humidity, temperature fluctuation, duration of sunshine,
and rainfall on malaria transmission while adjusting for seasonal variation,
between-year variation, and other climatic factors.
RESULTS: A 1°C increase in temperature was associated with a 17.7% [95%
confidence interval (CI): 16.9, 18.6%] increase in malaria incidence after a
3-week lag, a 10% rise in relative humidity was associated with 40.7% (95% CI:
-44.3, -36.9%) decrease in malaria after a 7-week lag, a 1°C increase in the
diurnal temperature range was associated with a 24.1% (95% CI: -26.7, -21.4%)
decrease in malaria after a 7-week lag, and a 10-hr increase in sunshine per week
was associated with a 5.1% (95% CI: -8.4, -1.7%) decrease in malaria after a
2-week lag. The cumulative relative risk for a 10-mm increase in rainfall (≤ 350 
mm) on P. vivax malaria was 3.61 (95% CI: 1.69, 7.72) based on a DLNM with a
10-week maximum lag.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that malaria transmission in temperate areas is
highly dependent on climate factors. In addition, lagged estimates of the effect 
of rainfall on malaria are consistent with the time necessary for mosquito
development and P. vivax incubation.

In order to tackle climate change effectively, the greenhouse gas emissions
produced in Korea should be assessed precisely. To do so, the nation needs to
accumulate country-specific data reflecting the specific circumstances
surrounding Korea's emissions. This paper analyzed element contents of domestic
anthracite, calorific value, and concentration of methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide
(N₂O) in the exhaust gases from circulating fluidized bed plant. The findings
showed the concentration of CH₄ and N₂O in the flue gas to be 1.85 and 3.25 ppm, 
respectively, and emission factors were 0.486 and 2.198 kg/TJ, respectively. The 
CH₄ emission factor in this paper was 52% lower than default emission factor
presented by the IPCC. The N₂O emission factor was estimated to be 46% higher
than default emission factor presented by the IPCC. This discrepancy can be
attributable to the different methods and conditions of combustion because the
default emission factors suggested by IPCC take only fuel characteristics into
consideration without combustion technologies. Therefore, Korea needs to
facilitate research on a legion of fuel and energy consumption facilities to
develop country-specific emission factors so that the nation can have a
competitive edge in the international climate change convention in the years to
come.

The possible consequences of global warming on plant communities and ecosystems
have wide-ranging ramifications. We examined how environmental change affects
plant growth as a function of the variations in the microclimate along an
urban-suburban climate gradient for two allergy-inducing, invasive plants,
Humulus japonicus and Ambrosia artemisiifolia var. elatior. The environmental
factors and plant growth responses were measured at two urban sites (Gangbuk and 
Seongbuk) and two suburban sites (Goyang and Incheon) around Seoul, South Korea. 
The mean temperatures and CO(2) concentrations differed significantly between the
urban (14.8 °C and 439 ppm CO(2)) and suburban (13.0 °C and 427 ppm CO(2)) sites.
The soil moisture and nitrogen contents of the suburban sites were higher than
those at the urban sites, especially for the Goyang site. The two invasive plants
showed significantly higher biomasses and nitrogen contents at the two urban
sites. We conducted experiments in a greenhouse to confirm the responses of the
plants to increased temperatures, and we found consistently higher growth rates
under conditions of higher temperatures. Because we controlled the other factors,
the better performance of the two invasive plants appears to be primarily
attributable to their responses to temperature. Our study demonstrates that even 
small temperature changes in the environment can confer significant competitive
advantages to invasive species. As habitats become urbanized and warmer, these
invasive plants should be able to displace native species, which will adversely
affect people living in these areas.

The Gas Metrology Group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology was
tasked, by a congressional climate change act, to support the atmospheric
measurement community through standards development of key greenhouse gases. This
paper discusses the development of a methane (CH(4)) primary standard gas mixture
(PSM) suite to support CH(4) measurement needs over a large amount-of-substance
fraction range 0.3-20,000 μmol mol(-1), but with emphasis at the atmospheric
level 300-4000 nmol mol(-1). Thirty-six CH(4) in dry air PSMs were prepared in
5.9 L high-pressure aluminum cylinders with use of a time-tested gravimetric
technique. Ultimately 14 of these 36 PSMs define a CH(4) standard suite covering 
the nominal ambient atmospheric range of 300-4000 nmol mol(-1). Starting
materials of pure CH(4) and cylinders of dry air were exhaustively analyzed to
determine the purity and air composition. Gas chromatography with
flame-ionization detection (GC-FID) was used to determine a CH(4) response for
each of the 14 PSMs where the reproducibility of average measurement ratios as a 
standard error was typically (0.04-0.26) %. An ISO 6134-compliant generalized
least-squares regression (GenLine) program was used to analyze the consistency of
the CH(4) suite. All 14 PSMs passed the u-test with residuals between the
gravimetric and the GenLine solution values being between -0.74 and 1.31 nmol
mol(-1); (0.00-0.16)% relative absolute. One of the 14 PSMs, FF4288 at 1836.16 ± 
0.75 nmol mol(-1) (k = 1) amount-of-substance fraction, was sent to the Korea
Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), the Republic of Korea's
National Metrology Institute, for comparison. The same PSM was subsequently sent 
to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for analysis to
their standards. Results show agreement between KRISS-NIST of +0.13% relative
(+2.3 nmol mol(-1)) and NOAA-NIST of -0.14% relative (-2.54 nmol mol(-1)).

Understanding how past climate changes affected biodiversity is a key issue in
contemporary ecology and conservation biology. These diversity changes are,
however, difficult to reconstruct from paleoecological sources alone, because
macrofossil and pollen records do not provide complete information about species 
assemblages. Ecologists therefore use information from modern analogues of past
communities in order to get a better understanding of past diversity changes.
Here we compare plant diversity, species traits and environment between
late-glacial Abies, early-Holocene Quercus, and mid-Holocene warm-temperate
Carpinus forest refugia on Jeju Island, Korea in order to provide insights into
postglacial changes associated with their replacement. Based on detailed study of
relict communities, we propose that the late-glacial open-canopy conifer forests 
in southern part of Korean Peninsula were rich in vascular plants, in particular 
of heliophilous herbs, whose dramatic decline was caused by the early Holocene
invasion of dwarf bamboo into the understory of Quercus forests, followed by
mid-Holocene expansion of strongly shading trees such as maple and hornbeam. This
diversity loss was partly compensated in the Carpinus forests by an increase in
shade-tolerant evergreen trees, shrubs and lianas. However, the pool of these
species is much smaller than that of light-demanding herbs, and hence the total
species richness is lower, both locally and in the whole area of the Carpinus and
Quercus forests. The strongly shading tree species dominating in the hornbeam
forests have higher leaf tissue N and P concentrations and smaller leaf dry
matter content, which enhances litter decomposition and nutrient cycling and in
turn favored the selection of highly competitive species in the shrub layer. This
further reduced available light and caused almost complete disappearance of
understory herbs, including dwarf bamboo.

The reactions of the public in Korea to the nuclear accident at the Fukushima
Daiichi plants in Japan, particularly over-reactions, are reviewed, with the
conclusion that significant radioactive contamination of a small country could
lead to a severe national crisis. The most important factor is the socio-economic
damage caused by stigma, which in turn is caused by a misunderstanding of the
radiation risk. Given that nuclear power is an important choice in the face of
the threat of climate change, the public's perceptions need to be changed at any 
cost, not only in those countries operating nuclear power plants but globally as 
well.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the health impacts of heat waves is important,
especially given anticipated increases in the frequency, duration, and intensity 
of heat waves due to climate change.
OBJECTIVES: We examined mortality from heat waves in seven major Korean cities
for 2000 through 2007 and investigated effect modification by individual
characteristics and heat wave characteristics (intensity, duration, and timing in
season).
METHODS: Heat waves were defined as ≥ 2 consecutive days with daily mean
temperature at or above the 98th percentile for the warm season in each city. We 
compared mortality during heat-wave days and non-heat-wave days using
city-specific generalized linear models. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to 
estimate overall effects within and across all cities. In addition, we estimated 
effects of heat wave characteristics and effects according to cause of death and 
examined effect modification by individual characteristics for Seoul.
RESULTS: Overall, total mortality increased 4.1% [95% confidence interval (CI):
-6.1%, 15.4%] during heat waves compared with non-heat-wave days, with an 8.4%
increase (95% CI: 0.1%, 17.3%) estimated for Seoul. Estimated mortality was
higher for heat waves that were more intense, longer, or earlier in summer,
although effects were not statistically significant. Estimated risks were higher 
for women versus men, older versus younger residents, those with no education
versus some education, and deaths that occurred out of hospitals in Seoul,
although differences among strata of individual characteristics were not
statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support evidence of mortality impacts from heat waves
and have implications for efforts to reduce the public health burden of heat
waves.

Author information:

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current cholera pandemic now involves almost the entire
developing world and represents an important global challenge. Though improved
water and sanitation remain the mainstays of cholera prevention efforts, major
improvements to infrastructure continue to be a goal far out of reach for many of
those affected and near-term interventions, including vaccines, need
consideration.
RECENT FINDINGS: Prolonged and frequent epidemics, increased antimicrobial
resistance, and heightening awareness of the role of climate change in disease
burden have returned cholera to the forefront of the international public health 
forum. The availability of new oral cholera vaccines and supporting data have
prompted the WHO to recommend vaccination be used with other prevention and
control strategies where disease is endemic, and their use should be considered
in outbreak situations.
SUMMARY: Vibrio cholerae, a highly transmissible organism, is found in aquatic
reservoirs and is not an eradicable disease. New variant strains appear to cause 
more severe clinical disease, and may be displacing earlier seventh pandemic
organisms as the major cause of cholera. Licensed newer-generation oral vaccines 
have proven to be well tolerated, protective (including against new variant
strains), and affordable and offer a new tool to control cholera.

OBJECTIVES: In order to evaluate which temperature index is the best predictor
for the health impact assessment of heat stress in Korea, several indexes were
compared.
METHODS: We adopted temperature, perceived temperature (PT), and apparent
temperature (AT), as a heat stress index, and changes in the risk of death for
Seoul and Daegu were estimated with 1℃ increases in those temperature indexes
using generalized additive model (GAM) adjusted for the non-temperature related
factors: time trends, seasonality, and air pollution. The estimated excess
mortality and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) due to the increased
temperature indexes for the 75th percentile in the summers from 2001 to 2008 were
compared and analyzed to define the best predictor.
RESULTS: For Seoul, all-cause mortality presented the highest percent increase
(2.99% [95% CI, 2.43 to 3.54%]) in maximum temperature while AIC showed the
lowest value when the all-cause daily death counts were fitted with the maximum
PT for the 75(th) percentile of summer. For Daegu, all-cause mortality presented 
the greatest percent increase (3.52% [95% CI, 2.23 to 4.80%]) in minimum
temperature and AIC showed the lowest value in maximum temperature. No lag effect
was found in the association between temperature and mortality for Seoul, whereas
for Daegu one-day lag effect was noted.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no one temperature measure that was superior to the others
in summer. To adopt an appropriate temperature index, regional meteorological
characteristics and the disease status of population should be considered.

Changing Transmission Pattern of Plasmodium vivax Malaria in the Republic of
Korea: Relationship with Climate Change.

Medicine and Science, Incheon, Korea.

Plasmodium vivax malaria has occurred annually in the Republic of Korea (ROK)
since its re-emergence in 1993. P. vivax malaria in ROK has been strongly
influenced by infected mosquitoes originating from the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea. Korean P. vivax malaria has shown typical characteristics of
unstable malaria transmitted only during the summer season, and displays short
and long incubation periods. The changing pattern of the transmission period can 
be predicted by analyzing the seasonal characteristics of early primary attack
cases with a short incubation period. Such cases began to gradually occur earlier
in the 1990s after the re-emergence. Most of the malaria cases after mid-August
are presumed to be early primary attack, short incubation period cases. Only
primary transmission was possible until the early 2000s, whereas up to fourth or 
fifth transmission occurred in the mid-2000s. The results indicate that the
length of transmission period has been gradually extending, which may be ascribed
to a climate change-mediated temperature rise. Malaria and climate data should be
integrated to analyze and predict the influence of climate change on malaria
occurrence in ROK.

Climate change induced by recent global warming may have a significant impact on 
vector-borne and zoonotic diseases. For example, the distribution of Japanese
encephalitis virus (JEV) has expanded into new regions. We surveyed the levels of
hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibodies against JEV (Family Flaviviridae,
genus Flavivirus) in wild birds captured in Korea. Blood samples were collected
from 1,316 wild birds including the following migratory birds: Oceanodroma castro
(n = 4), Anas formosa (n = 7), Anas penelope (n = 20), Fulica atra (n = 30), Anas
acuta (n = 89), Anas crecca (n = 154), Anas platyrhynchos (n = 214), Aix
galericulata (n = 310), and Anas poecilorhyncha (n = 488). All were captured in
16 locations in several Korea provinces between April 2007 and December 2009. Out
of the 1,316 serum samples tested, 1,141 (86.7%) were positive for JEV. Wild
birds captured in 2009 had a higher seroprevalence of ant-JEV antibodies than
those captured in 2007. Wild birds with an HI antibody titer of 1 : 1,280 or
higher accounted for 21.2% (280/1,316) of the animals tested. These findings
indicated that wild birds from the region examined in our study have been exposed
to JEV and may pose a high risk for introducing a new JEV genotype into Korea.

Medicine, Youngtong-gu, Suwon, South Korea.

BACKGROUND: Climate change could affect allergic diseases, especially due to
pollen. However, there has been no epidemiologic study to demonstrate the
relationship between meteorological factors, pollen, and allergic patients. We
aimed to investigate the association between meteorological variations and
hospital visits of patients with tree pollen allergy.
METHODS: The study subjects were adult patients who received skin prick tests
between April and July from 1999 to 2008. We reviewed the medical records for the
test results of 4,715 patients. Patients with tree pollen allergy were defined as
those sensitized to more than 1 of 12 tree pollen allergens. We used monthly
means of airborne tree pollen counts and meteorological factors:
maximum/average/minimum temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation. We
analyzed the correlations between meteorological variations, tree pollen counts, 
and the patient numbers. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to 
investigate the associations between meteorological factors and hospital visits
of patients.
RESULTS: The minimum temperature in March was significantly and positively
correlated with tree pollen counts in March/April and patient numbers from April 
through July. Pollen counts in March/April were also correlated with patient
numbers from April through July. After adjusting for confounders, including air
pollutants, there was a positive association between the minimum temperature in
March and hospital visits of patients with tree pollen allergy from April to
July(odds ratio, 1.14; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.25).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher temperatures could increase tree pollen counts, affecting the
symptoms of patients with tree pollen allergy, thereby increasing the number of
patients visiting hospitals.

Due to increasing concerns about environmental problems, climate change and
limited fossil resources, bio-based production of chemicals and polymers is
gaining attention as one of the solutions to these problems.
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are polyesters that can be produced by microbial
fermentation. PHAs are synthesized using monomer precursors provided from diverse
metabolic pathways and are accumulated as distinct granules inside the cells. On 
the other hand, most so-called bio-based polymers including polybutylene
succinate, polytrimethylene terephthalate, and polylactic acid (PLA) are
synthesized by a chemical process using monomers produced by fermentation. PLA,
an attractive biomass-derived plastic, is currently synthesized by heavy
metal-catalyzed ring opening polymerization of L-lactide that is made from
fermentation-derived L-lactic acid. Recently, a complete biological process for
the production of PLA and PLA copolymers from renewable resources has been
developed by direct fermentation of recombinant bacteria employing PHA
biosynthetic pathways coupled with a novel metabolic pathway. This could be
accomplished by establishing a pathway for generating lactyl-CoA and engineering 
PHA synthase to accept lactyl-CoA as a substrate combined with systems metabolic 
engineering. In this article, we review recent advances in the production of
lactate-containing homo- and co-polyesters. Challenges remaining to efficiently
produce PLA and its copolymers and strategies to overcome these challenges
through metabolic engineering combined with enzyme engineering are discussed.

The Star City rainwater harvesting system (RWHS) was featured in the December,
2008, issue of Water 21. The article highlighted that the RWHS has a 3,000 m3
rainwater tank used in water saving, flood mitigation, and emergency response.
Since then, many news media, public officials, and people from both South Korea
and abroad have visited the RWHS. In this paper, two years of the system's
operational data are presented and its role in short- and long-term climate
change adaptation is investigated. The downstream sewer system has become safe
for a 50-year rainfall without upgrading the existing sewer system, which was
designed for a 10-year period. The 26,000 m3 of water saved has reduced the
energy requirement of transferring water from a distant area. The success of the 
Star City RWHS has influenced 47 cities across South Korea, including Seoul, to
enact regulations on rainwater management. It has shown that decentralized
rainwater management can supplement the existing centralized system to ensure its
safety.

BACKGROUND: Meteorological disasters are an important component when considering 
climate change issues that impact morbidity and mortality rates. However, there
are few epidemiological studies assessing the causes and characteristics of
deaths from meteorological disasters. The present study aimed to analyze the
causes of death associated with meteorological disasters in Korea, as well as
demographic and geographic vulnerabilities and their changing trends, to
establish effective measures for the adaptation to meteorological disasters.
METHODS: Deaths associated with meteorological disasters were examined from 2,045
cases in Victim Survey Reports prepared by 16 local governments from 1990 to
2008. Specific causes of death were categorized as drowning, structural collapse,
electrocution, lightning, fall, collision, landslide, avalanche, deterioration of
disease by disaster, and others. Death rates were analyzed according to the
meteorological type, specific causes of death, and demographic and geographic
characteristics.
RESULTS: Drowning (60.3%) caused the greatest number of deaths in total, followed
by landslide (19.7%) and structural collapse (10.1%). However, the causes of
deaths differed between disaster types. The meteorological disaster associated
with the greatest number of deaths has changed from flood to typhoon. Factors
that raised vulnerability included living in coastal provinces (11.3 times higher
than inland metropolitan), male gender (1.9 times higher than female), and older 
age.
CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological analyses of the causes of death and vulnerability
associated with meteorological disasters can provide the necessary information
for establishing future adaptation measures against climate change. A more
comprehensive system for assessing disaster epidemiology needs to be established.

This study developed a new framework to quantify spatial vulnerability for
sustainable water resources management. Four hydrologic vulnerability
indices--potential flood damage (PFDC), potential drought damage (PDDC),
potential water quality deterioration (PWQDC), and watershed evaluation index
(WEIC)--were modified to quantify flood damage, drought damage, water quality
deterioration, and overall watershed risk considering the impact of climate
change, respectively. The concept of sustainability in the
Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework was applied in selecting 
all appropriate indicators (criteria) of climate change impacts. In the
examination of climate change, future meteorological data was obtained using
CGCM3 (Canadian Global Coupled Model) and SDSM (Statistical Downscaling Model),
and future stream run-off and water quality were simulated using HSPF
(Hydrological Simulation Program - Fortran). The four modified indices were then 
calculated using TOPSIS, a multi-attribute method of decision analysis. As a
result, the ranking obtained can be changed in consideration of climate change
impacts. This study represents a new attempt to quantify hydrologic vulnerability
in a manner that takes into account both climate change impacts and the concept
of sustainability.

Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Daejeon, South Korea. sunchaos@nims.re.kr

In order to study how climate change affects the territory size of subterranean
termites, a lattice model was used to simulate the foraging territory of the
Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki (Isoptera:
Rhinotermitidae), and the minimized local rules that are based on empirical data 
from the development of termites' foraging territory was applied. A landscape was
generated by randomly assigning values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 to each lattice
site, which represented the spatially distributed property of the landscape. At
the beginning of the simulation run, N territory seeds - one for each founding
pair, were randomly distributed on the lattice space. The territories grew during
the summer and shrank during the winter. In the model, the effects of climate
change were demonstrated by changes in two variables: the period of the summer
season, T, and the percentage of the remaining termite cells, σ, after the
shrinkage. The territory size distribution was investigated in the size
descending order for the values of T (= 10, 15, ... , 50) and σ (= 10, 15, ... , 
50) at a steady state after a sufficiently long time period. The distribution was
separated into two regions: the larger-sized territories and the smaller-sized
territories. The slope, m, of the distribution of territory size on a semi-log
scale for the larger-sized territories was maximal with T (45 ≤ T ≤ 50) in the
maximal range and with σ in the optimal range (30 ≤ σ ≤ 40), regardless of the
value of N. The results suggest that the climate change can influence the termite
territory size distribution under the proper balance of T and σ in combination.

The microbial community (bacterial, archaeal, and fungi) and eight genes involved
in the nitrogen biogeochemical cycle (nifH, nitrogen fixation; bacterial and
archaeal amoA, ammonia oxidation; narG, nitrate reduction; nirS, nirK, nitrite
reduction; norB, nitric oxide reduction; and nosZ, nitrous oxide reduction) were 
quantitatively assessed in this study, via real-time PCR with DNA extracted from 
three Antarctic soils. Interestingly, AOB amoA was found to be more abundant than
AOA amoA in Antarctic soils. The results of microcosm studies revealed that the
fungal and archaeal communities were diminished in response to warming
temperatures (10 °C) and that the archaeal community was less sensitive to
nitrogen addition, which suggests that those two communities are well-adapted to 
colder temperatures. AOA amoA and norB genes were reduced with warming
temperatures. The abundance of only the nifH and nirK genes increased with both
warming and the addition of nitrogen. NirS-type denitrifying bacteria outnumbered
NirK-type denitrifiers regardless of the treatment used. Interestingly, dramatic 
increases in both NirS and NirK-types denitrifiers were observed with nitrogen
addition. NirK types increase with warming, but NirS-type denitrifiers tend to be
less sensitive to warming. Our findings indicated that the Antarctic microbial
nitrogen cycle could be dramatically altered by temperature and nitrogen, and
that warming may be detrimental to the ammonia-oxidizing archaeal community. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to investigate genes
associated with each process of the nitrogen biogeochemical cycle in an Antarctic
terrestrial soil environment.

Biofuel from renewable biomass is one of the answers to help solve the problems
associated with limited fossil resources and climate change. Butanol has superior
liquid-fuel characteristics, with similar properties to gasoline, and thus, has
the potential to be used as a substitute for gasoline. Clostridia are recognized 
as a good butanol producers and are employed in the industrial-scale production
of solvents. Due to the difficulty of performing genetic manipulations on
clostridia, however, strain improvement has been rather slow. Furthermore,
complex metabolic characteristics of acidogenesis followed by solventogenesis in 
this strain have hampered the development of engineered clostridia strains with
highly efficient and selective butanol-production capabilities. In recent years, 
the butanol-producing characteristics in clostridia have been further
characterized and alternative pathways discovered. More recently, systems-level
metabolic engineering approaches were taken to develop superior strains. Herein, 
we review recent discoveries of metabolic pathways for butanol production and the
metabolic engineering strategies being developed.

Modern environmental- and occupational-related morbidities and mortality are
determined by the power relations inherent in our existing capitalist systems of 
production and consumption. These systems thwart human public health rights
because of the priority to maximize profit for the systems' owners rather than to
establish ecologically sound and socially just development for all. The
international public health community must return to its primary prevention roots
and take action to eliminate the potential for population morbidities that result
from hazardous substance exposures in work and community environments. The 1988
Adelaide Recommendations on Healthy Public Policy provide us with guidelines that
incorporate a human rights approach and build on several decades of international
public health declarations and charters. To succeed, public health must work with
the labor movement. A human rights approach to environmental public health can
help us make a transition to sustainable modes of production and consumption. The
environmental justice movement's strategy for an economic greening that sets as a
priority "pathways out of poverty" can help to advance environmental public
health rights.

The kinetics of CO(2) adsorption and desorption over amine-functionalized
mesoporous silica were investigated using silicon microcantilever arrays. Three
types of mesoporous silica with different pore sizes were synthesized and
functionalized with a variety of amine molecules. After depositing the silica
sorbents onto the free end of each cantilever in an array, mass changes due to
the adsorption and desorption of CO(2) were determined in situ with picogram
sensitivity by measuring variations in the cantilever frequencies. The adsorption
and desorption kinetics were found to be diffusion-controlled, and the kinetics
were accelerated by increasing the temperature and pore size. The activation
energies for adsorption and desorption of CO(2) were determined from Arrhenius
plots.

The costs associated with eight food waste disposal options, dry feeding, wet
feeding, composting, anaerobic digestion, co-digestion with sewage sludge, food
waste disposer, incineration, and landfilling, were evaluated in the perspective 
of global warming and energy and/or resource recovery. An expanded system
boundary was employed to compare by-products. Life cycle cost was analyzed
through the entire disposal process, which included discharge, separate
collection, transportation, treatment, and final disposal stages, all of which
were included in the system boundary. Costs and benefits were estimated by an
avoided impact. Environmental benefits of each system per 1 tonne of food waste
management were estimated using carbon prices resulting from CO(2) reduction by
avoided impact, as well as the prices of by-products such as animal feed,
compost, and electricity. We found that the cost of landfilling was the lowest,
followed by co-digestion. The benefits of wet feeding systems were the highest
and landfilling the lowest.

Increases in global temperatures have been shown to enhance glacier melting in
the Arctic region. Here, we have evaluated the effects of meltwater runoff on the
microbial communities of coastal marine sediment located along a transect of
Temelfjorden, in Svalbard. As close to the glacier front, the sediment properties
were clearly influenced by deglaciation. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 
profiles showed that the sediment microbial communities of the stations of
glacier front (stations 188-178) were distinguishable from that of outer fjord
region (station 176). Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that total
carbon and calcium carbonate in sediment and chlorophyll a in bottom water were
key factors driving the change of microbial communities. Analysis of 16S rRNA
gene clone libraries suggested that microbial diversity was higher within the
glacier-proximal zone (station 188) directly affected by the runoffs than in the 
outer fjord region. While the crenarchaeotal group I.1a dominated at station 176 
(62%), Marine Benthic Group-B and other Crenarchaeota groups were proportionally 
abundant. With regard to the bacterial community, alpha-Proteobacteria and
Flavobacteria lineages prevailed (60%) at station 188, whereas
delta-Proteobacteria (largely sulfate-reducers) predominated (32%) at station
176. Considering no clone sequences related to sulfate-reducers, station 188 may 
be more oxic compared to station 176. The distance-wise compositional variation
in the microbial communities is attributable to their adaptations to the sediment
environments which are differentially affected by melting glaciers.

The current seventh pandemic of cholera, caused by serogroup O1, El Tor biotype, 
has now involved almost the entire developing world. The ongoing dynamic
epidemiology of cholera, involving evolution of new strains, prolonged and more
frequent epidemics, increased antimicrobial resistance, and awareness of the role
of climate change upon the global burden has returned cholera to the forefront of
global public health discussions. Improved water and sanitation should continue
to be the mainstays of cholera-prevention efforts, but major improvements are a
far-off goal for much of the cholera-affected developing world. The advent of
safe and effective, new-generation oral vaccines against cholera has created
renewed interest in the use of vaccines as a tool to control cholera.

The greenhouse gases (GHGs) generated in municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration
are carbon dioxide (CO(2)), methane (CH(4)), and nitrous oxide (N(2)O). In South 
Korea case, the total of GHGs from the waste incineration facilities has been
increasing at an annual rate 10%. In these view, waste incineration facilities
should consider to reduce GHG emissions. This study is designed to estimate the
N(2)O emission factors from MSW incineration plants, and calculate the N(2)O
emissions based on these factors. The three MSW incinerators examined in this
study were either stoker or both stoker and rotary kiln facilities. The N(2)O
concentrations from the MSW incinerators were measured using gas
chromatography-electron capture detection (GC-ECD) equipment. The average of the 
N(2)O emission factors for the M01 plant, M02 plant, and M03 plant are 71, 75,
and 153g-N(2)O/ton-waste, respectively. These results showed a significant
difference from the default values of the intergovernmental panel on climate
change (IPCC), while approaching those values derived in Japan and Germany.
Furthermore, comparing the results of this study to the Korea Energy Economics
Institute (KEEI) (2007) data on waste incineration, N(2)O emissions from MSW
incineration comprised 19% of the total N(2)O emissions.

Owing to our increasing concerns on the environment, climate change, and limited 
natural resources, there has recently been considerable effort exerted to produce
chemicals and materials from renewable biomass. Polymers we use everyday can also
be produced either by direct fermentation or by polymerization of monomers that
are produced by fermentation. Recent advances in metabolic engineering combined
with systems biology and synthetic biology are allowing us to more systematically
develop superior strains and bioprocesses for the efficient production of
polymers and monomers. Here, we review recent trends in microbial production of
building block chemicals that can be subsequently used for the synthesis of
polymers. Also, recent successful cases of direct one-step production of polymers
are reviewed. General strategies for the production of natural and unnatural
platform chemicals are described together with representative examples.

Effects of UV radiation on marine ectotherms in polar regions.

Ozone-related increase in solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) during the last
decades provided an important ecological stressor, particularly for polar
ecosystems since these are less adapted to such changes. All life forms appear to
be susceptible to UVR to a highly variable extent that depends on individual
species and their environment. Differences in sensitivity between organisms may
relate to efficiency differences of their protection mechanisms and repair
systems. UVR impacts are masked by large seasonal and geographic differences even
in confined areas like the polar regions. UVR has effects and responses on
various integration levels: from genetics, physiology, biology, populations,
communities, to functional changes as in food webs with consequences on material 
and energy circulations through ecosystems. Even at current levels, solar UV-B
affects consumer organisms, such as ectotherms (invertebrates and fish),
particularly through impediments on critical phases of their development (early
life history stages such as gametes, zygotes and larvae). Despite the overall
negative implications of UVR, effect sizes vary widely in, e.g., molecular
damage, cell and tissue damage, survival, growth, behavior, histology, and at the
level of populations, communities and ecosystems.

Plant molecular phylogeography in China and adjacent regions: Tracing the genetic
imprints of Quaternary climate and environmental change in the world's most
diverse temperate flora.

The Sino-Japanese Floristic Region (SJFR) of East Asia harbors the most diverse
of the world's temperate flora, and was the most important glacial refuge for its
Tertiary representatives ('relics') throughout Quaternary ice-age cycles. A
steadily increasing number of phylogeographic studies in the SJFR of mainland
China and adjacent areas, including the Qinghai-Tibetan-Plateau (QTP) and
Sino-Himalayan region, have documented the population histories of temperate
plant species in these regions. Here we review this current literature that
challenges the oft-stated view of the SJFR as a glacial sanctuary for temperate
plants, instead revealing profound effects of Quaternary changes in climate,
topography, and/or sea level on the current genetic structure of such organisms. 
There are three recurrent phylogeographic scenarios identified by different case 
studies that broadly agree with longstanding biogeographic or palaeo-ecological
hypotheses: (i) postglacial re-colonization of the QTP from (south-)eastern
glacial refugia; (ii) population isolation and endemic species formation in
Southwest China due to tectonic shifts and river course dynamics; and (iii)
long-term isolation and species survival in multiple localized refugia of
(warm-)temperate deciduous forest habitats in subtropical (Central/East/South)
China. However, in four additional instances, phylogeographic findings seem to
conflict with a priori predictions raised by palaeo-data, suggesting instead:
(iv) glacial in situ survival of some hardy alpine herbs and forest trees on the 
QTP platform itself; (v) long-term refugial isolation of (warm-)temperate
evergreen taxa in subtropical China; (vi) 'cryptic' glacial survival of
(cool-)temperate deciduous forest trees in North China; and (vii) unexpectedly
deep (Late Tertiary/early-to-mid Pleistocene) allopatric-vicariant
differentiation of disjunct lineages in the East China-Japan-Korea region due to 
past sea transgressions. We discuss these and other consequences of the main
phylogeographic findings in light of palaeo-environmental evidence, emphasize
notable gaps in our knowledge, and outline future research prospects for
disentangling the evolution and biogeographic history of the region's extremely
diverse temperate flora.

Rapid estimation of triacylglycerol content of Chlorella sp. by thermogravimetric
analysis.

A simple and reliable method based on thermogravimetric analysis has been
developed for determining triacylglycerol content in Chlorella sp. KR-1. There
are two decomposing steps during pyrolysis of the microalgal cells and the second
step of weight loss may be attributed to degradation and volatilization of
triacylglycerols. The second peak height in the temperature derivatives of weight
loss increased with the triacylglycerol content of the microalgal cells and the
peak was around 390 °C regardless of the triacylglycerol contents. Based on these
findings, a linear equation for determining triacylglycerol content was derived. 
The proposed method gives satisfactory results, showing small variance and a good
interpolation capability.

OBJECTIVES: Infectious diseases are known to be affected by climate change. We
investigated if the infectious diseases were related to meteorological factors in
Korea.
METHODS: Scrub typhus, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS),
leptospirosis, malaria and Vibrio vulnificus sepsis among the National Notifiable
Infectious Diseases were selected as the climate change-related infectious
diseases. Temperature, relative humidity and precipitation were used as
meteorological factors. The study period was from 2001 through 2008. We examined 
the seasonality of the diseases and those correlations with meteorological
factors. We also analyzed the correlations between the incidences of the diseases
during the outbreak periods and monthly meteorological factors in the
hyper-endemic regions.
RESULTS: All of the investigated diseases showed strong seasonality; malaria and 
V. vulnificus sepsis were prevalent in summer and scrub typhus, HFRS and
leptospirosis were prevalent in the autumn. There were significant correlations
between the monthly numbers of cases and all the meteorological factors for
malaria and V. vulnificus sepsis, but there were no correlation for the other
diseases. However, the incidence of scrub typhus in hyper-endemic region during
the outbreak period was positively correlated with temperature and humidity
during the summer. The incidences of HFRS and leptospirosis had positive
correlations with precipitation in November and temperature and humidity in
February, respectively. V. vulnificus sepsis showed positive correlations with
precipitation in April/May/July.
CONCLUSIONS: In Korea, the incidences of the infectious diseases were correlated 
with meteorological factors, and this implies that the incidences could be
influenced by climate change.

This study described the development and validation of an artificial neural
network (ANN) for the purpose of analyzing the effects of climate change on
nonpoint source (NPS) pollutant loads from agricultural small watershed. The
runoff discharge was estimated using ANN algorithm. The performance of ANN
modelwas examined using observed data from s tudy watershed. The
simulationresults agreed well with observed values during calibration and
validation periods. NPS pollutant loads were calculated from load-discharge
relationship driven by long-term monitoring data. LARS-WG (Long Ashton Research
Station-Weather Generator) model was used to generate rainfall data. The
calibrated ANN model and load-discharge relationship with the generated data from
LARS-WGwere applied to analyze the effects of climate change on NPS pollutant
loads from the agricultural small watershed. The results showed that the ANN
model provided valuable approach i n estimating future runof f discharge, and the
NPS pollutantloads.

The effluence of veterinary antibiotics (VAs) to aquatic and terrestrial
environments is of concern due to the potential adverse effects on human health, 
such as the production of antibiotic resistant bacteria. One of the main pathways
for antibiotics to enter the environment is via the application of manure and/or 
manure-based composts as an alternative organic fertilizer to agricultural lands.
While a wide diversity of manure-based composts are produced in Korea, there is
currently no regulatory guideline for VA residues. Hence, monitoring and limiting
the concentration of VA residues in manure and/or manure-based composts prior to 
application to the lands is important to mitigate any environmental burden. The
current study was conducted to examine the applicability of the Charm II
antibiotic test system for monitoring tetracyclines, sulfonamides and macrolides 
in manure-based composts. The Charm II system was a highly reproducible method
for determining whether VA residue concentrations in manure-based compost
exceeded specific guideline values. A wide range of manure-based composts and
liquid fertilizers commercially available in Korea were examined using the Charm 
II system to monitor the residues of the target VAs. For this, the guideline
concentrations of VA residues (0.8 mg kg(-1) for tetracyclines, 0.2 mg kg(-1) for
sulfonamides, and 0.1 mg kg(-1) for macrolides) stated in 'Official Standard of
Feeds' under the 'Control of Livestock and Fish Feed Act' in Korea were adopted
to establish control points. Of the 70 compost samples examined 12 exceeded 0.8
mg kg(-1) for tetracyclines and 21 exceeded 0.2 mg kg(-1) for sulfonamides. Of
the 25 liquid fertilizer samples examined most samples exceeded these prospective
guidelines.

Genetic transformation using a micro-cross section (MCS) technique was conducted 
to improve the carotenoid content in kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa cv. Hayward).
The introduced carotenoid biosynthetic genes include geranylgeranyl diphosphate
synthase (GGPS), phytoene desaturase (PDS), ζ-carotene desaturase (ZDS),
β-carotene hydroxylase (CHX), and phytoene synthase (PSY). The transformed
explants were selected on half-strength MS medium containing 0.001 mg l(-1) of
2,4-D and 0.1 mg l(-1) of zeatin, either 5 mg l(-1) hygromycin or 25 mg l(-1)
kanamycin, and 500 mg l(-1) cefotaxime. The genomic PCR, genomic Southern blot
analysis, and RT-PCR were performed to confirm the integration and expression of 
the transgenes. The transformation efficiencies of either kanamycin- or
hygromycin-resistant shoots ranged from 2.9 to 22.1% depending on the target
genes, and from 2.9 to 24.2% depending on the reporter genes. The selection
efficiencies ranged from 66.7 to 100% for the target genes and from 95.8 to 100% 
for the reporter genes. Changes of carotenoid content in the several PCR-positive
plants were determined by UPLC analysis. As a result, transgenic plants
expressing either GGPS or PSY increased about 1.2- to 1.3-fold in lutein or
β-carotene content compared to non-transgenic plants. Our results suggest that
the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation efficiency of kiwifruit can be greatly 
increased by this MCS method and that the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway can be 
modified in kiwifruit by genetic transformation. Our results further suggest that
GGPS and PSY genes could be major target genes to increase carotenoid contents in
kiwifruit.

As a consequence of warming temperatures around the world, spring and autumn
phenologies have been shifting, with corresponding changes in the length of the
growing season. Our understanding of the spatial and interspecific variation of
these changes, however, is limited. Not all species are responding similarly, and
there is significant spatial variation in responses even within species. This
spatial and interspecific variation complicates efforts to predict phenological
responses to ongoing climate change, but must be incorporated in order to build
reliable forecasts. Here, we use a long-term dataset (1953-2005) of plant
phenological events in spring (flowering and leaf out) and autumn (leaf colouring
and leaf fall) throughout Japan and South Korea to build forecasts that account
for these sources of variability. Specifically, we used hierarchical models to
incorporate the spatial variability in phenological responses to temperature to
then forecast species' overall and site-specific responses to global warming. We 
found that for most species, spring phenology is advancing and autumn phenology
is getting later, with the timing of events changing more quickly in autumn
compared with the spring. Temporal trends and phenological responses to
temperature in East Asia contrasted with results from comparable studies in
Europe, where spring events are changing more rapidly than are autumn events. Our
results emphasize the need to study multiple species at many sites to understand 
and forecast regional changes in phenology.

PURPOSE: Climate change affects human health and calls for health meteorological 
services. The purpose of this study is to find the significant predictors for the
demands of the health meteorological information.
METHODS: This study used a descriptive design through structured self-report
questionnaires. Data from 956 participants who were at least 18 years old and
living in Busan, Korea, were collected from June 1 to July 31, 2009. The data was
analyzed using a decision tree method, one of the data mining techniques by SAS
9.1 and Enterprise Miner 4.3 program.
RESULTS: Two hundred and ninety participants (30.3%) demanded the information,
and 505 of them (52.8%) perceived the necessity of health meteorological
information. From the decision tree method, the predictors related to the demands
of the health meteorological information were determined as "the perception of
the necessity of health meteorological information," "the coping to the weather
warnings" and "the importance of the weather forecasting in daily life." In
Particular, the significant different variables in the perception of the
necessity of health meteorological information were "female," "aged over 40" and 
"environmental diseases." Thus, the model derived in this study is considered for
explaining and predicting the demands of health meteorological information.
CONCLUSIONS: It can be effectively used as a reference model for future studies
and is a suggested direction in health meteorological information service and
policy development. We suggest health forecasting as a nursing service and a
primary health care network for healthier and more comfortable life.

The objective of this study was to estimate the carbon storage capacity of Pinus 
densiflora stands using remotely sensed data by combining digital aerial
photography with light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. A digital canopy model
(DCM), generated from the LiDAR data, was combined with aerial photography for
segmenting crowns of individual trees. To eliminate errors in over and
under-segmentation, the combined image was smoothed using a Gaussian filtering
method. The processed image was then segmented into individual trees using a
marker-controlled watershed segmentation method. After measuring the crown area
from the segmented individual trees, the individual tree diameter at breast
height (DBH) was estimated using a regression function developed from the
relationship observed between the field-measured DBH and crown area. The above
ground biomass of individual trees could be calculated by an image-derived DBH
using a regression function developed by the Korea Forest Research Institute. The
carbon storage, based on individual trees, was estimated by simple multiplication
using the carbon conversion index (0.5), as suggested in guidelines from the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The mean carbon storage per individual
tree was estimated and then compared with the field-measured value. This study
suggested that the biomass and carbon storage in a large forest area can be
effectively estimated using aerial photographs and LiDAR data.

To predict changes in South Korean vegetation distribution, the Warmth Index (WI)
and the Minimum Temperature of the Coldest Month Index (MTCI) were used.
Historical climate data of the past 30 years, from 1971 to 2000, was obtained
from the Korea Meteorological Administration. The Fifth-Generation National
Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) /Penn State Mesoscale Model (MM5) was used
as a source for future climatic data under the A1B scenario from the Special
Report on Emission Scenario (SRES) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC). To simulate future vegetation distribution due to climate change, 
the optimal habitat ranges of Korean tree species were delimited by the thermal
gradient indices, such as WI and MTCI. To categorize the Thermal Analogy Groups
(TAGs) for the tree species, the WI and MTCI were orthogonally plotted on a
two-dimensional grid map. The TAGs were then designated by the analogue
composition of tree species belonging to the optimal WI and MTCI ranges. As a
result of the clustering process, 22 TAGs were generated to explain the forest
vegetation distribution in Korea. The primary change in distribution for these
TAGs will likely be in the shrinkage of areas for the TAGs related to Pinus
densiflora and P. koraiensis, and in the expansion of the other TAG areas, mainly
occupied by evergreen broad-leaved trees, such as Camellia japonica,
Cyclobalanopsis glauca, and Schima superba. Using the TAGs to explain the effects
of climate change on vegetation distribution on a more regional scale resulted in
greater detail than previously used global or continental scale vegetation
models.

Predictive monitoring and diagnosis of periodic air pollution in a subway
station.

Studies, Kyung Hee University, 1 Seochon-dong, Giheung-gu, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do

The purpose of this study was to develop a predictive monitoring and diagnosis
system for the air pollutants in a subway system using a lifting technique with a
multiway principal component analysis (MPCA) which monitors the periodic patterns
of the air pollutants and diagnoses the sources of the contamination. The basic
purpose of this lifting technique was to capture the multivariate and periodic
characteristics of all of the indoor air samples collected during each day. These
characteristics could then be used to improve the handling of strong periodic
fluctuations in the air quality environment in subway systems and will allow
important changes in the indoor air quality to be quickly detected. The
predictive monitoring approach was applied to a real indoor air quality dataset
collected by telemonitoring systems (TMS) that indicated some periodic variations
in the air pollutants and multivariate relationships between the measured
variables. Two monitoring models--global and seasonal--were developed to study
climate change in Korea. The proposed predictive monitoring method using the
lifted model resulted in fewer false alarms and missed faults due to
non-stationary behavior than that were experienced with the conventional methods.
This method could be used to identify the contributions of various pollution
sources.

This study evaluated feed manufacturing including dry feeding and wet feeding,
composting, and landfilling for food waste disposal options from the perspective 
of global warming and resource recovery. The method of the expanded system
boundaries was employed in order to compare different by-products. The whole
stages of disposal involved in the systems such as separate discharge,
collection, transportation, treatment, and final disposal, were included in the
system boundary and evaluated. The Global Warming Potential generated from 1tonne
of food wastes for each disposal system was analyzed by the life cycle assessment
method. The results showed that 200kg of CO(2)-eq could be produced from dry
feeding process, 61kg of CO(2)-eq from wet feeding process, 123kg of CO(2)-eq
from composting process, and 1010kg of CO(2)-eq from landfilling. Feed
manufacturing and composting, the common treatment methods currently employed,
have been known to be environment friendlier than other methods. However, this
study shows that they can negatively affect the environment if their by-products 
are not appropriately utilized as intended.

This study investigated the influence of Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) root
exudation on soil solution properties (pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), metal 
solubility) in the rhizosphere using a rhizobox. Measurement was conducted
following the cultivation of Indian mustard in the rhizobox filled four different
types of heavy metal contaminated soils (two alkaline soils and two acidic
soils). The growth of Indian mustard resulted in a significant increase (by 0.6
pH units) in rhizosphere soil solution pH of acidic soils and only a slight
increase (< 0.1 pH units) in alkaline soils. Furthermore, the DOC concentration
increased by 17-156 mg/L in the rhizosphere regardless of soil type and the
extent of contamination, demonstrating the exudation of DOC from root. Ion
chromatographic determination showed a marked increase in the total dissolved
organic acids (OAs) in rhizosphere. While root exudates were observed in all
soils, the amount of DOC and OAs in soil solution varied considerably amongst
different soils, resulting in significant changes to soil solution metals in the 
rhizosphere. For example, the soil solution Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn concentrations
increased in the rhizosphere of alkaline soils compared to bulk soil following
plant cultivation. In contrast, the soluble concentrations of Cd, Pb, and Zn in
acidic soils decreased in rhizosphere soil when compared to bulk soils. Besides
the influence of pH and DOC on metal solubility, the increase of heavy metal
concentration having high stability constant such as Cu and Pb resulted in a
release of Cd and Zn from solid phase to liquid phase.

This study is to assess the future impact of climate change on hydrological
behavior considering future vegetation canopy prediction and its propagation to
nonpoint source pollution (NPS) loads. The SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) 
model was used for the assessment. For a forest dominant ChungjuDam watershed of 
South Korea, the MIROC3.2hires climate data of SRES A1B and B1 scenarios were
adopted and downscaled for the watershed. The future vegetation canopy
information was projected by the monthly relationship between Terra MODIS
(MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) LAI (Leaf Area Index) and
temperature. The future predicted LAI increased up to 1.9 in 2080s April and
October because of the temperature increase 3.6 degrees C and 5.3 degrees C
respectively. By reflecting the future LAI changes, the future estimated percent 
changes of maximum annual dam inflow, SS, T-N, and T-P were + 42.5% in 2080s
A1B,-35.6% in 2020s A1B,+73.7% in 2080s A1B and-21.0% in 2080s B1 scenario
respectively. The increase of T-N load was from the increase of subsurface
lateral flows and the groundwater recharges by the future rainfall increase. The 
decrease of T-P load was by decrease of sediment load during wet days because the
effect of LAI increase is greater than the increase of rainfall.

Changes in butterfly abundance in response to global warming and reforestation.

In the Republic of Korea, most denuded forest lands have been restored since the 
1960s. In addition, the annual mean temperature in the Republic of Korea has
increased approximately 1.0 degrees C during the last century, which is higher
than the global mean increase of 0.74 degrees C. Such rapid environmental changes
may have resulted in changes in the local butterfly fauna. For example, the
number of butterflies inhabiting forests may have increased because of
reforestation, whereas the number of butterflies inhabiting grasslands may have
declined. Furthermore, the number of northern butterflies may have declined,
whereas the number of southern butterflies may have increased in response to
global warming. Therefore, we compared current data (2002 approximately 2007)
regarding the abundance of butterfly species at two sites in the central portion 
of the Korean Peninsula to data from the late 1950s and early 1970s for the same 
sites. Changes in the abundance rank of each species between the two periods were
evaluated to determine whether any patterns corresponded to the predicted
temporal changes. The predicted changes in butterfly abundance were confirmed in 
this study. In addition, the results showed a different response to habitat
change between northern and southern species. In northern butterfly species,
butterflies inhabiting forests increased, whereas those inhabiting grasslands
declined. However, the opposite was true when southern butterfly species were
evaluated. Changes in the abundance indicate that habitat change may be one of
the key factors related to the survival of populations that remain around the
southern boundary of butterfly species.

To investigate annual variation in soil respiration (R (S)) and its components
[autotrophic (R (A)) and heterotrophic (R (H))] in relation to seasonal changes
in soil temperature (ST) and soil water content (SWC) in an Abies holophylla
stand (stand A) and a Quercus-dominated stand (stand Q), we set up trenched plots
and measured R (S), ST and SWC for 2 years. The mean annual rate of R (S) was 436
mg CO(2) m(-2) h(-1), ranging from 76 to 1,170 mg CO(2) m(-2) h(-1), in stand A
and 376 mg CO(2) m(-2) h(-1), ranging from 82 to 1,133 mg CO(2) m(-2) h(-1), in
stand Q. A significant relationship between R (S) and its components and ST was
observed over the 2 years in both stands, whereas a significant correlation
between R (A) and SWC was detected only in stand Q. On average over the 2 years, 
R (A) accounted for approximately 34% (range 17-67%) and 31% (15-82%) of the
variation in R (S) in stands A and Q, respectively. Our results suggested that
vegetation type did not significantly affect the annual mean contributions of R
(A) or R (H), but did affect the pattern of seasonal change in the contribution
of R (A) to R (S).

The current status and challenges associated with the production and utilization 
of cellulosic ethanol in Korea are reviewed in this paper. Cellulosic ethanol has
emerged as a promising option for mitigating Korea's CO(2) emissions and
enhancing its energy security. Korea's limited biomass resources is the most
critical barrier to achieving its implementation targets for cellulosic ethanol. 
Efforts to identify new suitable biomass resources for cellulosic ethanol
production are ongoing and intensive. Aquatic biomasses including macroalgae and 
plantation wastes collected in the Southeast Asia region have been found to have 
great potential as feedstocks for the production of cellulosic ethanol. R&D
explorations into the development of technologies that can convert biomass
materials to ethanol more efficiently also are underway. It is expected that
cellulosic ethanol will be in supply from 2020 and that, by 2030, its use will
have effectively reduced Korea's total gasoline consumption by 10%.

Recent dramatic increases in food prices in much of the world have caused much
concern, and have even resulted in some public protests and riots. This is easy
to understand given the large percentages of incomes that the poor devote to food
purchases. Many commentators have predicted that food supplies in the
Asia-Pacific region will become much more limited in the future as the result of 
population growth, the rapid growth of cities, new food demands by a growing
middle class, the impacts of climate change, and the growth of a global food
industry. But will these possible shortages of food result in pressures that will
destabilise the security situation in the region? Recent work of the whole
concept of security has resulted in some redefinition of the term to include
issues of human security, but it could also be argued that severe strains on the 
human security situation could even result in increased instability in the more
traditional kind of security regime. The extreme case of North Korea is used as
an example of how this might happen. But we really do not know if such dangers
are real ones for the region as a whole, and it is suggested that much more
research is needed in this area. The whole concept of resilience has been used in
some studies elsewhere and this may be useful starting point for new work in this
area.

Food and health security in North East Asia including South Korea, North Korea,
China and Japan was compared. Because this region contains countries with many
complex problems, it is worthwhile to study the current situation. With about 24%
of the world's population, all North East Asian countries supply between 2400 and
3000 Kcal of energy. Regarding health status, two extreme problems exist. One is 
malnutrition in North Korea and China and the other is chronic degenerative
disease in Japan, South Korea and China. Because quality, quantity and safety of 
the food supply have to be secured for health security, some topics are selected 
and discussed. 1) World food price can have an effect on food security for
countries with a low food self sufficiency rate such as Japan and Korea;
specially, for the urban poor. 2) Population aging can increase the number of
aged people without food security. An aged population with less income and no
support from their off-spring, because of disappearing traditional values, may
have food insecurity. 3) Population growth and economic growth in this region may
worsen food problems. Since a quarter of the world's population resides in this
region, populations will continue to increase. With economic growth, people will 
consume more animal products. 4) Climate change generates food production
problems. As the progress of industry continues, there will be less land for food
and more pollutants in the environment. 5) Political instability will cause food 
insecurity and conflict will cause problems with regard to food aid.

Despite the use of recyclable materials increasing worldwide, waste disposal to
landfill remains the most common method of waste management because it is simple 
and relatively inexpensive. Although landfill disposal is an effective waste
management system, if not managed correctly, a number of potential detrimental
environmental impacts have been identified including soil and ground water
contamination, leachate generation, and gas emissions. In particular, improper
post-closure treatment of landfills or deterioration of the conventional clay
landfill capping were shown to result in land degradation which required
remediation to secure contaminants within the landfill site. Phytoremediation is 
an attractive technology for landfill remediation, as it can stabilize soil and
simultaneously remediate landfill leachate. In addition, landfill
phytoremediation systems can potentially be combined with landfill covers
(Phytocapping) for hydrological control of infiltrated rainfall. However, for the
successful application of any phytoremediation system, the effective
establishment of appropriate, desired vegetation is critical. This is because the
typically harsh and sterile nature of landfill capping soil limits the
sustainable establishment of vegetation. Therefore, the physicochemical
properties of landfill capping soils often need to be improved by incorporating
soil amendments. Biosolids are a common soil amendment and will often meet these 
demanding conditions because they contain a variety of plant nutrients such as
nitrogen, phosphate, potassium, as well as a large proportion of organic matter. 
Such amendment will also ameliorate the physical properties of the capping soils 
by increasing porosity, moisture content, and soil aggregation. Contaminants
which potentially originate from biosolids will also be remediated by activities 
congruent with the establishment of plants and bacteria.

Global environmental change poses emerging environmental health challenges
throughout the world. One of such threats could be found in chemical safety in
aquatic ecosystem. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of several
environmental factors, such as water pH, temperature and ultraviolet light on the
toxicity of pharmaceutical compounds in water, using freshwater invertebrate
Daphnia magna. Seven pharmaceuticals including ibuprofen, acetaminophen,
lincomycin, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, chlortetracycline and sulfathiazole were
chosen as test compounds based on their frequent detection in water. The
experimental conditions of environmental parameters were selected within the
ranges that could be encountered in temperate environment, i.e., water
temperature (15, 21, and 25 degrees C), pH (7.4, 8.3, and 9.2), and UV-B light
intensity (continuous irradiation of 15.0 microW/cm(2)). For acetaminophen,
enrofloxacin and sulfathiazole, decrease in water pH generally led to increase of
acute lethal toxicity, which could be explained by the unionized fraction of
pharmaceuticals. Increase of water temperature enhanced the acute toxicity of the
acetaminophen, enrofloxacin and chlortetracycline, potentially due to alteration 
in toxicokinetics of chemicals as well as impact on physiological mechanisms of
the test organism. The presence of UV-B light significantly increased the
toxicity of sulfathiazole, which could be explained by photo-modification of this
chemical that lead to oxidative stress. Under the UV light, however, acute
toxicity of enrofloxacin decreased, which might be due to photo-degradation.
Since changing environmental conditions could affect exposure and
concentration-response profile of environmental contaminants, such conditions
should be identified and evaluated in order to better manage ecosystem health
under changing global environment.

An overview is provided of the potential effects of climate change on the
watershed biogeochemical processes and surface water quality in mountainous
watersheds of Northeast (NE) Asia that provide drinking water supplies for large 
populations. We address major 'local' issues with the case studies conducted at
three watersheds along a latitudinal gradient going from northern Japan through
the central Korean Peninsula and ending in southern China. Winter snow regimes
and ground snowpack dynamics play a crucial role in many ecological and
biogeochemical processes in the mountainous watersheds across northern Japan. A
warmer winter with less snowfall, as has been projected for northern Japan, will 
alter the accumulation and melting of snowpacks and affect hydro-biogeochemical
processes linking soil processes to surface water quality. Soils on steep
hillslopes and rich in base cations have been shown to have distinct patterns in 
buffering acidic inputs during snowmelt. Alteration of soil microbial processes
in response to more frequent freeze-thaw cycles under thinner snowpacks may
increase nutrient leaching to stream waters. The amount and intensity of summer
monsoon rainfalls have been increasing in Korea over recent decades. More
frequent extreme rainfall events have resulted in large watershed export of
sediments and nutrients from agricultural lands on steep hillslopes converted
from forests. Surface water siltation caused by terrestrial export of sediments
from these steep hillslopes is emerging as a new challenge for water quality
management due to detrimental effects on water quality. Climatic predictions in
upcoming decades for southern China include lower precipitation with large
year-to-year variations. The results from a four-year intensive study at a
forested watershed in Chongquing province showed that acidity and the
concentrations of sulfate and nitrate in soil and surface waters were generally
lower in the years with lower precipitation, suggesting year-to-year variations
in precipitation as a key factor in modulating the effects of acid deposition on 
soil and surface water quality of this region. Results from these case studies
suggest that spatially variable patterns of snow or summer precipitation
associated with regional climate change across NE Asia will have significant
impacts on watershed biogeochemical processes and surface water quality, in
interactions with local topography, land use change, or acid deposition.

Extreme ambient temperature has been associated with increased daily mortality
across the world. We describe the ambient temperature-mortality association for
four capital cities in East Asia, Seoul, Beijing, Tokyo, and Taipei, and identify
a threshold temperature for each city and the percent increase in mortality. We
adapted generalized linear modeling with natural cubic splines (GLM+NS) to
examine the association between daily mean apparent temperature (AT) and total
mortality, as well as mortality due to respiratory (RD) and cardiovascular (CVD) 
causes in a threshold model. We conducted a time-series analysis adjusting for
day of the week and long-term time trend. The study period differed by city. The 
threshold temperature for all seasons was estimated to be 30.1-33.5 degrees C,
31.3-32.3 degrees C, 29.4-30.8 degrees C, and 25.2 degrees -31.5 degrees C for
Seoul, Beijing, Tokyo, and Taipei, respectively, on the same day. For the mean
daily AT increase of 1 degrees C above the thresholds in Seoul, Tokyo, and
Taipei, estimated percentage increases in daily total mortality were 2.7 (95%
confidence interval (CI)=2.2-3.1), 1.7 (95% CI=1.5-2.0), and 4.3 (95%
CI=2.9-5.7), respectively. Beijing provided no total mortality counts. Estimated 
percentage increases were 2.7-10.5 for RD mortality, 1.1-9.3 for CVD mortality in
4 cities. This study identified increased mortality due to exposure to elevated
AT. The importance of effects of AT and city-specific threshold temperatures
suggests that analyses of the impact of climate change should take regional
differences into consideration.

In the present study, gasification of biodiesel by-product, crude glycerin, was
performed in an entrained flow gasifier. Gasification was conducted in a
temperature range of 950-1500 degrees C and excess air ratio of 0.17-0.7 for air 
or oxygen as a gasification agent. From the results, syngas heating value, carbon
conversion and cold gas efficiency of more than 2500 kcal/Nm(3), 92% and 65% were
achieved, respectively. The H(2)/CO ratio of the product gas was varied from 1.25
to 0.7 with the excess air ratio and this gas composition was favorable for DME
synthesis. The optimum excess air ratio for gasification of biodiesel by-product 
was evaluated to be an approximately 0.35-0.4. The present results indicate that 
crude glycerin can be utilized as a feedstock for gasification to make syngas.

Plasmodium vivax malaria, which re-emerged in the Republic of Korea (ROK) in
1993, had decreased since 2001. However, case numbers began to increase again in 
2005. The number of cases rose 54.0% in 2006, but the rate of increase slowed
down in 2007. Among the total of 4,206 cases of P. vivax malaria during
2006-2007, 756 cases (18.0%) were ROK military personnel, 891 cases (21.2%) were 
veterans, and 2,559 cases (60.8%) were civilians. The rapid increase during this 
period was mostly contributed by the western part of the malaria-risk areas that 
is under the influence of adjacent North Korea. Local transmission cases in ROK
have also increased gradually and the transmission period seemingly became
longer. Chemoprophylaxis in the military should be re-assessed in view of
chloroquine-resistance. Continuous surveillance and monitoring are warranted to
prevent further expansion of P. vivax malaria caused by climate change in ROK.

El Niño events, characterized by anomalous warming in the eastern equatorial
Pacific Ocean, have global climatic teleconnections and are the most dominant
feature of cyclic climate variability on subdecadal timescales. Understanding
changes in the frequency or characteristics of El Niño events in a changing
climate is therefore of broad scientific and socioeconomic interest. Recent
studies show that the canonical El Niño has become less frequent and that a
different kind of El Niño has become more common during the late twentieth
century, in which warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the central Pacific are
flanked on the east and west by cooler SSTs. This type of El Niño, termed the
central Pacific El Niño (CP-El Niño; also termed the dateline El Niño, El Niño
Modoki or warm pool El Niño), differs from the canonical eastern Pacific El Niño 
(EP-El Niño) in both the location of maximum SST anomalies and
tropical-midlatitude teleconnections. Here we show changes in the ratio of CP-El 
Niño to EP-El Niño under projected global warming scenarios from the Coupled
Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 multi-model data set. Using calculations
based on historical El Niño indices, we find that projections of anthropogenic
climate change are associated with an increased frequency of the CP-El Niño
compared to the EP-El Niño. When restricted to the six climate models with the
best representation of the twentieth-century ratio of CP-El Niño to EP-El Niño,
the occurrence ratio of CP-El Niño/EP-El Niño is projected to increase as much as
five times under global warming. The change is related to a flattening of the
thermocline in the equatorial Pacific.

Since the first nuclear weapons tests in the 1940s, pulsed inputs of plutonium
isotopes have served as excellent tracers for understanding sources, pathways,
dynamics and the fate of pollutants and particles in the marine environment. Due 
to the well-defined spatial and temporal inputs of Pu, the long half-lives of
(240)Pu and (239)Pu and its unique chemical properties, Pu is a potential tracer 
for various physical and biogeochemical ocean processes, including circulation,
sedimentation and biological productivity, and hence a means of assessing the
impacts of global climate change. Due to the source dependency of the Pu isotopic
signature, plutonium isotopes are beginning to be exploited as tools for the
evaluation and improvement of regional and global ocean models that will enhance 
understanding of past and future changes in the oceans. This paper addresses the 
major sources of Pu and the physical and biogeochemical behaviour in the marine
environment. Finally, the use of Pu isotopes as tracers for various oceanic
processes (e.g. water mass transport, particle export, and sedimentation) is
considered.

Molecular phylogeography of East Asian Kirengeshoma (Hydrangeaceae) in relation

Kirengeshoma comprises two species inhabiting warm temperate-deciduous forests in
East China/South Japan (Kirengeshoma palmata) and South Korea (Kirengeshoma
koreana). A survey of chloroplast (cp) DNA and inter-simple sequence repeats
(ISSRs) variation in Kirengeshoma was carried out to determine the population
history of a plant taxon around the East China Sea (ECS). CpDNA and ISSRs
revealed lower genetic divergence between China and Japan relative to the other
contrasts, in line with intrageneric classification. Molecular dating suggests
that K. koreana diverged at the Plio-Pleistocene boundary from the Japanese
populations, whereas the latter migrated into China during the early-to-mid
Pleistocene via the ECS basin. Vicariant segregation of Chinese and Japanese
populations likely occurred during the mid-Pleistocene. Mismatch distributions
and neutrality tests indicated that Chinese populations expanded their range
during the Late Pleistocene, probably during a cold period, whereas those from
Japan showed no significant population growth. We conclude that the current
distribution and differentiation of components of presently isolated warm
temperate-deciduous forests in China, Japan and Korea likely resulted from a
combination of relatively ancient vicariant and immigration events, and those
from Japan were particularly sensitive to range fragmentation and long-term
refugial isolation throughout the Late Pleistocene.

Methane emission estimation from landfills in Korea (1978-2004): quantitative
assessment of a new approach.

Kim HS(1), Yi SM.

Author information:

National University, Seoul, Korea.

Quantifying methane emission from landfills is important to evaluating measures
for reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To quantify GHG emissions and
identify sensitive parameters for their measurement, a new assessment approach
consisting of six different scenarios was developed using Tier 1 (mass balance
method) and Tier 2 (the first-order decay method) methodologies for GHG
estimation from landfills, suggested by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC). Methane emissions using Tier 1 correspond to trends in disposed
waste amount, whereas emissions from Tier 2 gradually increase as disposed waste 
decomposes over time. The results indicate that the amount of disposed waste and 
the decay rate for anaerobic decomposition were decisive parameters for emission 
estimation using Tier 1 and Tier 2. As for the different scenarios, methane
emissions were highest under Scope 1 (scenarios I and II), in which all landfills
in Korea were regarded as one landfill. Methane emissions under scenarios III,
IV, and V, which separated the dissimilated fraction of degradable organic carbon
(DOC(F)) by waste type and/or revised the methane correction factor (MCF) by
waste layer, were underestimated compared with scenarios II and III. This
indicates that the methodology of scenario I, which has been used in most
previous studies, may lead to an overestimation of methane emissions.
Additionally, separate DOC(F) and revised MCF were shown to be important
parameters for methane emission estimation from landfills, and revised MCF by
waste layer played an important role in emission variations. Therefore, more
precise information on each landfill and careful determination of parameter
values and characteristics of disposed waste in Korea should be used to
accurately estimate methane emissions from landfills.

I evaluated long-term changes in hydrological conditions (temperature, salinity
and dissolved oxygen) in Korean sea waters in relation to the regional land
climate change (air temperature and precipitation) based on available
meteorological and oceanographic data. Regression analyses, spatial patterns and 
cross-correlations on the climatologic and hydrological factors suggested that
industrialization processes and related urban heat-island effects during the past
37 years from 1968 to 2005 in South Korea have increased land surface
temperatures by 1.267 degrees C, at least for the urban areas, and subsequently
increased sea surface temperatures by 0.975 degrees C and decreased salinities by
0.229. The influence of land surface temperature on the sea water temperature
reached at least 75-m depth. Regarding the causality in the land-ocean climate
changes, air-temperature changes preceded sea water temperature change by 0-2
months in spring and summer; but the sequence could be reversed, possibly because
of potential heat held by the ocean. This study demonstrated that human factors
have been driving warming influences on regional sea waters, impacting marine
ecosystems and changing dominant fish species in commercial fishery catches of
Korea.

An assessment of how future climate change will impact regional air quality
requires projecting emissions many decades into the future in a consistent
manner. An approach that integrates the impact of both the current regulations
and the longer-term national and global trends is developed to construct an
emissions inventory (EI) for North America for the mid-century in support of a
regional modeling study of ozone and particulate matter (PM) less than or equal
to 2.5 microm (PM2.5). Because the time horizon of such a distant projection is
beyond that of EIs used in typical modeling studies, it is necessary to identify 
a practical approach that allows the emission projections to account for emission
controls and climatic and energy-use changes. However, a technical challenge
arises because this requires integration of various different types of
information with which emissions from human activities are associated. Often,
emission information in global models has less detail and uses coarser
spatiotemporal resolution. The method developed here is based on data
availability, spatiotemporal coverage and resolution, and future-scenario
consistency (i.e., Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on
Emissions Scenarios [IPCC SRES] A1B), and consists of two major steps: (1)
near-future EI projection (to the year 2020), and (2) longer-term EI projection
(to mid-century). The first step is based closely on the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency Clean Air Interstate Rule EI, the Environment Canada EI, as
well estimates of Mexico's EI; whereas the second step follows approaches
proposed by the EI from the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment
(IMAGE), developed by Netherlands's National Institute for Public Health and the 
Environment (RIVM). For the United States, the year-2050 emissions for nitrogen
oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), PM2.5, anthropogenic volatile organic
compounds (VOCs), and ammonia are projected to change by -55, -55, -30, -40, and 
+20%, respectively, compared with 2001. NOx and SO2 emission changes are very
similar in total amount but different in sectoral contribution. The projected
emission trends for Canada and Mexico differ considerably. After taking into
account the modeled climate changes, biogenic VOC emission increases from three
countries overwhelm the decreases in anthropogenic VOC emissions, leading to a
net small increase (approximately 2%) in overall VOC emissions.

Predictions of future species' ranges under climate change are needed for
conservation planning, for which species distribution models (SDMs) are widely
used. However, global climate model-based (GCM) output grids can bias the area
identified as suitable when these are used as SDM predictor variables, because
GCM outputs, typically at least 50x50 km, are biologically coarse. We tested the 
assumption that species ranges can be equally well portrayed in SDMs operating on
base data of different grid sizes by comparing SDM performance statistics and
area selected by four SDMs run at seven grid sizes, for nine species of
contrasting range size. Area selected was disproportionately larger for SDMs run 
on larger grid sizes, indicating a cut-off point above which model results were
less reliable. Up to 2.89 times more species range area was selected by SDMs
operating on grids above 50x50 km, compared to SDMs operating at 1 km2. Spatial
congruence between areas selected as range also diverged as grid size increased, 
particularly for species with ranges between 20000 and 90000 km2. These results
indicate the need for caution when using such data to plan future protected
areas, because an overly large predicted range could lead to inappropriate
reserve location selection.

In this study, immobilized TiO(2) electrode is applied to reduce toxic Cr(VI) to 
non-toxic Cr(III) in aqueous solution under UV irradiation. To overcome the
limitation of powder TiO(2), a novel technique of immobilization based on
anodization was applied and investigated under various experimental conditions.
The anodization was performed at 20V-5 degrees C for 45min with 0.5% hydrofluoric
acid, and then the anodized samples were annealed under oxygen stream in the
range 450-850 degrees C. Based on the results of the experiments, the
photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction was favorable in acidic conditions, with
approximately 98% of the Cr(VI) being reduced within 2h at pH 3. Among the
samples tested under same anodizing condition, the nanotubular TiO(2) annealed at
450 and 550 degrees C showed highest reduction efficiencies of Cr(VI). In
addition, the surface characterizations (zeta potential, XRD, and SEM) of these
samples proved that the Cr(VI) reduction efficiency was higher under acidic
conditions and at a lower annealing temperature. From this research, it was
concluded that the anodized TiO(2) has the potential to be a useful technology
for environmental remediation as well as photocatalytic hydrogen production from 
water.

Three-year (2004-2006) monitoring results of macrolepidoptera using light traps
in a temperate deciduous mixed forest were analyzed to investigate the
relationship between moth diversity and nine weather variables. Results of
stepwise regression analyses showed that mean daily temperature was the main
predictor for moth diversity. The present study also revealed that each moth
family was affected by a set of different weather factors (rainfall, relative
humidity, or duration of sunshine) probably due to different life-history
strategies. The impacts of recent climate change on insect populations may be
evidenced in the close relationship between moth abundance and mean temperature.

The United Nations Framework Conventions on Climate Change (UNFCCC) asks their
Parties to submit a National Inventory Report (NIR) for greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions on an annual basis. However, when many countries are quickly growing
their economy, resulting in substantial GHG emissions, their inventory reporting 
systems either have not been established or been able to be linked to planning of
mitigation measures at national administration levels. The present research was
aimed to quantify the GHG emissions from an environmental sector in Taiwan and
also to establish a linkage between the developed inventories and development of 
mitigation plans. The "environmental sector" consists of public service under
jurisdiction of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration: landfilling, 
composting, waste transportation, wastewater treatment, night soil treatment, and
solid waste incineration. The preliminary results were compared with that of the 
United States, Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, and Korea, considering the gaps in
the scopes of the sectors. The GHG emissions from the Taiwanese environmental
sector were mostly estimated by following the default methodology in the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change guideline, except that of night soil
treatment and waste transportation that were modified or newly developed. The GHG
emissions from the environmental sectors in 2004 were 10,225 kilotons of CO2
equivalent (kt CO2 Eq.). Landfilling (48.86%), solid waste incineration (27%),
and wastewater treatment (21.5%) were the major contributors. Methane was the
most significant GHG (70.6%), followed by carbon dioxide (27.8%) and nitrous
oxide (1.6%). In summary, the GHG emissions estimated for the environmental
sector in Taiwan provided reasonable preliminary results that were consistent and
comparable with the existing authorized data. On the basis of the inventory
results and the comparisons with the other countries, recommendations of
mitigation plans were made, including wastewater and solid waste recycling,
methane recovery for energy, and waste reduction/sorting.

The authors conducted a time-series analysis to estimate the acute effects of
high temperature in 6 cities in Korea and to compare thresholds of temperature on
daily mortality among the cities. They examined the association between total
mortality and the daily mean temperature and heat index during the summers in
Korea from 1994 to 2003. The threshold temperature was estimated to be between
27.0 degrees C and 29.7 degrees C for 4 cities. For a daily mean temperature
increase of 1 degrees C above the thresholds in Seoul, Daegu, Incheon, and
Gwangju, estimated percentage increases in daily mortality were 16.3 (95%
confidence interval [CI] = 14.2-18.4), 9.10 (CI = 5.12-13.2), 7.01 (CI =
4.42-9.66), and 6.73 (CI = 2.47-11.2), respectively. These city-specific
threshold temperatures and the magnitude of the effects of hot temperature
indicate that any analysis of the impact of climate change should take into
account regional differences.

Freshwater availability is affected by changes in climate and growth. We assessed
the freshwater vulnerability for five major Korean river basins for 2015 and
2030. We used a regional climate model based on the IPCC SRES A2 scenario, US
Geological Survey's Precipitation Rainfall Simulation Model, and population and
industrial growth scenarios for impact assessment. The model simulation results
suggest increasing spatial and temporal variations of water stress for the basins
that are already developed. While freshwater is more vulnerable to growth
scenarios than the climate change scenario, climate change alone could decrease
mean annual runoff by 10% in four major river basins by 2030. As the first
national assessment of climate change, we suggest possible adaptive water
resource management and policy strategies for reducing climate related risks in
Korea.

For close to half a century nuclear fission has been providing reliable supplies 
of electricity to the UK, with virtually no emissions of carbon dioxide. Over
that period, the UK nuclear industry has avoided the emission of over one and a
half billion tonnes of CO2. Yet no nuclear plant has been built in the UK for
over two decades even though many of the stations in our current fleet are now
within a decade or so of the end of their lifetime. Without new plants being
ordered soon, the UK's nuclear capacity will decline dramatically, from 23% today
to 3% post-2020--just as considerations of supply security and climate change are
becoming increasingly important. Elsewhere in the world, many countries such as
China, India, Japan, South Korea, Finland and France are building new stations.
Other countries such as the USA, South Africa, and some nations that currently do
not have nuclear stations (such as Indonesia and Poland) are making preparations 
for future nuclear stations. Globally capacity factors for nuclear plants are
higher than they have ever been, averaging around 85% and with the best stations 
achieving well over 90%. Lifetime can be 60 years. That the economics of such
stations compete well with other technologies is well founded and easily
verifiable--especially in the face of rising fossil fuel prices and the pricing
in of costs for CO2 emissions--both of which stand to improve the economics of
nuclear energy still further. Waste volumes arising from modern plants are just a
fraction of those of some earlier stations, and the technologies are in place to 
deal with them safely and effectively. Following recent reviews and international
developments, there is growing confidence that internationally available
competitive designs of nuclear plant will provide part of the solution to the
UK's long-term energy needs.

Increase in carbon emissions from forest fires after intensive reforestation and 
forest management programs.

This paper shows an example of substantial increase in carbon emissions from
forest fires after reforestation on a national scale. It is the first estimation 
of historical carbon emissions from forest fires in Korea during the last 40
years. Investigation was focused on the recent increase in large forest fires and
its closely related factors. A simple modeling approach to estimate carbon
emission was applied. The direct carbon emission from forest fires in 2000,
ranging from 115 to 300 Gg C, corresponds to 1-3% of the annual carbon uptake by 
forests. The influence of forest fires on the carbon cycle in Korea is not so
significant, but Korean forests have a large potential for generating severe
local fires due to increasing forest carbon density and a high forest area ratio 
(forest area/total land area) of 65%. The carbon emission per area burned (Mg C
ha(-1)) clearly reflects the trend toward increases in the number of severe
fires. Statistical analyses and the trends of annual temperature and
precipitation show that the recent large increase in carbon emissions may be the 
negative consequences of intensive forest regrowth that is the product of
successful reforestation and forest management programs rather than the effect of
climate change. These results imply a need for further studies in other
countries, where large-scale plantation has been conducted, to evaluate the role 
of plantation and forest fires on the global carbon cycle.

We used a terrestrial ecosystem process model, BIOME-BGC, to investigate
historical climate change and fire disturbance effects on regional carbon and
water budgets within a 357,500 km(2) portion of the Canadian boreal forest.
Historical patterns of increasing atmospheric CO2, climate change, and regional
fire activity were used as model drivers to evaluate the relative effects of
these impacts to spatial patterns and temporal trends in forest net primary
production (NPP) and evapotranspiration (ET). Historical trends of increasing
atmospheric CO2 resulted in overall 13% and 5% increases in annual NPP and ET
from 1994 to 1996, respectively. NPP was found to be relatively sensitive to
changes in air temperature (T(a)), while ET was more sensitive to precipitation
(P) change within the ranges of observed climate variability (e.g., +/-2 degrees 
C for T(a) and +/-20% for P). In addition, the potential effect of climate change
related warming on NPP is exacerbated or offset depending on whether these
changes are accompanied by respective decreases or increases in precipitation.
Historical fire activity generally resulted in reductions of both NPP and ET,
which consumed an average of approximately 6% of annual NPP from 1959 to 1996.
Areas currently occupied by dry conifer forests were found to be subject to more 
frequent fire activity, which consumed approximately 8% of annual NPP. The
results of this study show that the North American boreal ecosystem is sensitive 
to historical patterns of increasing atmospheric CO2, climate change and regional
fire activity. The relative impacts of these disturbances on NPP and ET interact 
in complex ways and are spatially variable depending on regional land cover and
climate gradients.

The radiative properties of atmospheric aerosols are determined by their masses, 
chemical characteristics, and optical properties, such as aerosol optical depth
(AOD), Angström parameter (alpha) and single scattering albedo (SSA). In
particular, the aerosol optical properties determine the surface temperature
perturbation that may give some information in understanding regional atmospheric
radiative forcing. To understand the radiative forcing and regional source of an 
aerosol, the present study focused on the analysis of the aerosol optical
properties based on two different observations in the spring season, during the
special Asian dust storm period. The Korean Global Atmosphere Watch Observatory
(KGAWO), at Anmyeon Island, and the ACE-Asia super-site, at Gosan, Jeju Island,
have measured radiations and aerosols since 2000. The sites are located in the
mid-west and south of the Korean peninsula, which are strongly affected by the
Asian dust coming from China every spring. The aerosol optical properties,
measured by ground-based sun and sky radiometers, over both sites were analyzed
to gain an understanding of the radiation and climate properties. The probability
distributions of the aerosol optical depths were rather narrow, with a modal
value of approximately 0.38 at both sites during 2001 and 2002. The Angström
parameter frequency distributions showed two peaks at Anmyeon GAW, but only one
peak at the Jeju ACE-Asia super site. One peak, around 0.63, characterizes the
situation of a day having Asian dust, the second peak, around 1.13, corresponded 
to the relatively dust-free cases. The correlation between the aerosol optical
depth and the Angström exponents resulted in a wide range of the Angström
parameter, alpha, over a wide range of optical depths at Anmyeon, whereas a
narrow range of alpha, with moderate to low values for the AOD at Jeju. Under
dust free conditions the single scattering albedo (SSA) decreased with
wavelength, while in the presence of Asian dust, the SSA either stayed neutral,
or increased slightly with wavelength at Anmyeon, and showed higher value than
Jeju. The change in the surface temperature was highly correlated with increases 
in the aerosol optical depth at Anmyeon to a greater extent than at Jeju.

Acid gas absorption technology is of great importance in these days for the
prevention of global warming and the resulting worldwide climate change. More
efficient process design and development for the removal of acid gases has become
important, together with the development of new absorbents as one of urgent areas
of research in addressing global-warming problems. In the present work, aqueous
solutions of 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol (AHPD), a sterically
hindered amine, has been examined as a potential CO2 absorbent and compared with 
the most commonly used absorbent, monoethanolamine (MEA) solution, through
equilibrium solubility measurements and 13C NMR spectroscopic analyses. The
solubilities of CO2 in aqueous 10 mass % AHPD solutions were higher than those in
aqueous 10 mass % MEA solutions above 4 kPa at 298.15 K, but below 4 kPa, the
solubility behavior appeared to be the opposite. The solubility difference
between these two solutions increased with the CO2 partial pressures above the
crossover pressure. Equilibrated CO2-MEA-H2O and CO2-AHPD-H2O solutions at
various CO2 partal pressures ranging from 0.01 to 3000 kPa were analyzed by 13C
NMR spectroscopy to provide a more microscopic understanding of the reaction
mechanisms in the two solutions. In the CO2-amine-H2O solutions, amine reacted
with CO2 to form mainly the protonated amine (AMH+), bicarbonate ion (HCO3-), and
carbamate anion (AMCO2-), where the quantitative ratio of bicarbonate ion to
carbamate anion strongly influenced the CO2 loading in the amine solutions. A
profusion of bicarbonate ions, but a very small amount of carbamate anions, was
identified in the CO2-AHPD-H2O solution, whereas a considerable amount of
carbamate anions was formed in the CO2-MEA-H2O solution. AHPD contains more
hydroxyl groups than nonhindered MEA, and hence, the chemical shifts in its 13C
NMR spectra were strongly influenced by the solution pH values. In contrast, MEA 
appeared to be insensitive to pH. The strong interrelations among CO2 solubility,
CO2 partial pressure, bulkiness of the amine structure, and pH identified through
the present experimental investigations can provide basic guidelines for finding 
new potential organic absorbents, including specifically designed amine
chemicals.

Accumulation of tributyltin (TBT) was determined in liver of olive flounder
exposed to TBT (3.65, 36.5, 365, 3,650, and 7,300 ng Sn/L) for 10 or 30 days,
followed by 60 days depuration. Effect of TBT on hepatic cytochrome P450 content 
was also measured in liver of olive flounder. TBT was highly accumulated in liver
of fish during the 10- to 30-day exposures, and hepatic cytochrome P450 content
decreased with increasing TBT concentration. Hepatic cytochrome P450 contents
were affected in olive flounder exposed to even environmentally relevant TBT
concentrations, such as 3.65 ng Sn/L. In addition, the liver TBT levels
demonstrated strong negative correlation to the hepatic cytochrome P450 content. 
The effects started to appear from 20 ng Sn/g dry weight of TBT in liver.
Tributyltin concentrations and hepatic cytochrome P450 were also determined in
feral fine-spotted flounder. The relationship between other organic pollutants
known as cytochrome P450 inducers (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls) as well as
TBT and hepatic cytochrome P450 in the feral fish implied that TBT even at ppt
level could impose antagonistic effects on hepatic cytochrome P450 induction.

were in the range of 1.24-41.4, 0.28-89.2, 0.02-0.59, nd-1.03, and nd-2.56 ng/g, 
respectively. The spatial distribution of OCs showed a negative gradient from the
inner of the bay to outer part of the bay, indicating that the source of OCs was 
probably located inside the bay. Compositional pattern of PCB congeners showed a 
relatively high concentration of high-chlorinated congeners in the inner part of 
the bay and a relatively low concentration of low-chlorinated congeners in the
outer part. In sediment core from Masan Bay maximum concentrations of PCBs and
DDTs are observed in the subsurface samples and correspond to an age of early
1980s and late 1960s. The concentration profiles of PCBs and DDTs in sediments of
Masan Bay appear to correspond to use of PCBs and DDTs in Korea.

Butyltin compounds were quantitatively determined in surface sediment and
sediment core samples near shipyards in the south coast of Korea, which is one of
the major ship building industries in the world. Tributyltin (TBT) concentrations
reached up to 46100 ng Sn/g on a dry-weight basis at the front of the shipyard.
Horizontal distribution of butyltin compounds was closely related to dry-docking 
activities. Butyltin concentrations were relatively low where remote from the
sources. The vertical distribution of TBT in sediment cores showed active use of 
TBT in Korean peninsula for the past decades. The increase of TBT concentrations 
in sediment core according to estimated sediment age demonstrated a positive
correlation with the increase of gross tonnage of ships built in the shipyard for
20 years. High TBT residue levels in sediment core samples raise concerns over
persistence of the compound in the marine environment.

Accumulation of tributyltin (TBT) in serum, liver, muscle, and gill of olive
flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) was examined in a 30-d static-renewal exposure.
Tributyltin accumulated rapidly in the serum of the olive flounder and to a
greater extent than in the other tissues. The accumulated TBT concentrations in
tissues were in the order of serum > gill > liver > muscle on a dry-weight basis.
Tributyltin also was detected in the serum of feral fine-spotted flounder,
Pleuronichthys cornutus, collected from the coastal area. The mean TBT
concentration in serum (2,470 ng Sn/g) of the fine-spotted flounder was about 40 
times higher than that in the liver (60 ng Sn/g) and 200 times higher than that
in the muscle (27 ng Sn/g) on a dry-weight basis. The TBT concentrations in serum
and sediment demonstrated a positive correlation. The percent TBT composition to 
total butyltin was much higher in the serum (71%) than in the other tissues and
sediment (<47%). These results suggest that the analysis of fish blood serum
could be a useful tool for monitoring exposure to TBT in the marine environment.

Carbon dioxide is an important greenhouse gas and a major agent of climate
change. This study quantified carbon (C) emissions from energy consumption and C 
storage and uptake by greenspace for three cities in middle Korea: Chuncheon,
Kangleung, and Seoul. Carbon emissions were estimated using C emission
coefficients for fossil fuels consumed. Carbon storage and uptake by woody plants
were computed applying biomass equations and radial growth rates. The soils in
Chuncheon were cored to analyze organic C storage. Annual C emissions were 37.0
t/ha/yr in Kangleung, 47.2 t/ha/yr in Chuncheon, and 264.9 t/ha/yr in Seoul. Mean
C storage by woody plants ranged from 26.0 to 60.1 t/ha for natural lands within 
the study cities, and from 4.7 to 7.2 t/ha for urban lands (all land use types
except natural and agricultural lands). Mean annual C uptake by woody plants
ranged from 1.60 to 3.91 t/ha/yr for natural lands within the cities, and from
0.53 to 0.80 t/ha/yr for urban lands. There were no significant differences (95% 
confidence level) between the cities in C storage and uptake per ha for urban
lands. Organic C storage in Chuncheon soils (to a depth of 60 cm) averaged 31.6
t/ha for natural lands and 24.8 t/ha for urban lands. Woody plants stored an
amount of C equivalent to 6.0-59.1% of total C emissions within the cities, and
annually offset total C emissions by 0.5-2.2%. Carbon storage in soils was 1.2
times greater than that by woody plants in Chuncheon. The C reduction benefits of
woody plants were greater in Chuncheon and Kangleung, where areal distribution of
natural lands was larger and the population density lower than in Seoul.
Strategies to increase C storage and uptake by urban greenspace were explored.

The expansion of the industrial economy and the increase of population in
Northeast Asian countries have caused much interest in climate monitoring related
to global warming. However, new techniques and better platforms for the
measurement of global warming and regional databases are still old-fashioned and 
are not being developed sufficiently. With respect to this agenda, since 1993, at
the request of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), to monitor functions 
of global warming, the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) has set up a
Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) Station on the western coast of Korea (Anmyun-do) 
and has been actively monitoring global warming over Northeast Asia. In addition,
atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has been measured for a similar KMA global
warming program at Kosan, Cheju Island since 1990. Aerosol and radiation have
also been measured at both sites as well as in Seoul. The observations have been 
analyzed using diagnostics of climate change in Northeast Asia and also have been
internationally compared. Results indicate that greenhouse gases are in good
statistic agreement with the NOAA/Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory
(CMDL) long-term trends of monthly mean concentrations and seasonal cycles.
Atmospheric particulate matter has also been analyzed for particular Asian types 
in terms of optical depth, number concentration and size distribution.

Concern about climate change has evoked interest in the potential for urban
vegetation to help reduce the levels of atmospheric carbon. This study applied
computer simulations to try to quantify the modifying effects of existing
vegetation on the indirect reduction of atmospheric carbon for two residential
neighborhoods in north-west Chicago. The effects of shading, evapotranspiration, 
and windspeed reduction were considered and were found to have decreased carbon
emissions by 3.2 to 3.9% per year for building types in study block 1 where tree 
cover was 33%, and -0.2 to 3.8% in block 2 where tree cover was 11%. This
resulted in a total annual reduction of carbon emission averaging 158.7 (+/-
12.8) kg per residence in block 1 and 18.1 (+/- 5.4) kg per residence in block 2.
Windspeed reduction greatly contributed to the decrease of carbon emission.
However, shading increased annual carbon emission from the combined change in
heating and cooling energy use due to many trees in the wrong locations, which
increase heating energy use during the winter. The increase of carbon emission
from shading is somewhat specific to Chicago, due in part to the large amount of 
clean, nuclear-generated cooling energy and the long heating season. In Chicago, 
heating energy is required for about eight months from October to May and cooling
energy is used for the remaining 4 months from June to September. If fossil fuels
had been the primary source for cooling energy and the heating season had been
shorter, the shading effects on the reduction of carbon emission would be
greater. Planting of large trees close to the west wall of buildings, dense
planting on the north, and avoidance of planting on the south are recommended to 
maximize indirect carbon reduction by residential vegetation, in Chicago and
other mid and high-latitude cities with long heating seasons.

Many factors contribute to the development of continuous ambulatory peritoneal
dialysis (CAPD) peritonitis. The role of climate in CAPD peritonitis has received
relatively little attention. We retrospectively analyzed the incidence of CAPD
peritonitis according to temperature and relative humidity. Data from 80 patients
were examined. The monthly mean temperature and relative humidity during study
period varied between -3.4 degrees C and 25.4 degrees C and between 61% and 81%, 
respectively. In 1123 patient-months, 53 cases of peritonitis occurred. The
occurrence of peritonitis paralleled temperature and relative humidity, being the
highest (0.180 episodes/patient-month) in July (mean temperature, 24.6 degrees C;
relative humidity, 81%) and lowest (0.013 episodes/patient-month) in November
(mean temperature, 6.6 degrees C; relative humidity, 66%). Significant
correlations were seen between the monthly frequency of CAPD peritonitis and
temperature (r = 0.53, p < 0.05) and relative humidity (r = 0.59, p < 0.05). The 
incidence was higher in the warm season (months with a mean temperature > or = 15
degrees C, that is, May-September) than in the cold season (months with a mean
temperature < 15 degrees C, that is, October-April), at 0.074
episodes/patient-month versus 0.024 episodes/patient-month, p < 0.05. We also
found a tendency for gram-negative peritonitis to occur uniformly throughout the 
year, but for gram-positive peritonitis to increase during hot and humid months, 
especially the rainy month of July. Gram-positive organisms caused 50% of
peritonitis from March to August, but just 17.7% from September to February.
Gram-negative organisms caused 7.3% and 29.4% of peritonitis during the same
periods (p < 0.05). The results indicate a clear seasonal change in the rate of
CAPD peritonitis and in the causative micro-organisms. The observation that CAPD 
peritonitis increases in the season of high temperature and high humidity
suggests the influence of climate on CAPD peritonitis in the temperate zone.

Age and seasonal distribution of menarche in Korean girls.

Park SH, Shim YK, Kim HS, Eun BL.

PIP: This paper examines the menarchal age of Korean girls and its monthly
distribution to define the possible relationship between menarche and season.
Menarchal age is influenced by diverse factors such as hereditary, geography,
climate, psychological factors, socioeconomic status, body weight and height,
nutritional state, body fat and exercise as well as the presence of chronic
illness. In Korea, there is evidence of secular change toward earlier menarchal
age, where the average menarchal age was 14.8 in 1952, 14.4 years in 1979, 13.4
years in 1986, and 12.5 years in 1988. A cross-sectional study was conducted from
July 1993 to July 1995 among 4237 female middle and high school students, aged
14-20 years, in Ansan, Korea, to obtain data on demographic characteristics,
menarchal age, month of menarche, and the menarchal age of the participant's
mother. Findings revealed that average menarchal age is 12.5 years for the girls 
and 15.4 +or- 2.3 years for their mothers. Menarche is most common in August and 
January (summer), January and December (winter) in decreasing order. Seasonal
pattern of menarche may also be related to the psychological factors during
school vacation such as relaxation, decrease stress from studies, and/or physical
rest.

Transition to manhood: effects of the Great Depression on male youth.

Scheibach M.

This paper has been an exploration into the social and psychological problems
associated with male youth growing up in the 1930s. By first defining and
understanding the major transitions to adulthood--exiting from school, leaving
the house of origin, entering the labor force, getting married, and establishing 
a separate household--it was then possible to explore how these transitions were 
affected by social, economic, and political factors in the Depression. It was
also possible to examine how these factors affected the search for identify and
role development in male youth. The historical study of adolescence in America
has concentrated primarily on demographic data and observable behavior. Likewise,
psychological studies on adolescence have concentrated on the recent past, and
have tended to look at the individual rather than the relationship between the
individual and/or cohort, and the social values and mores as well as economic and
political conditions of the period under study. Youth culture, which can be
defined as a socially recognized and institutionalized adolescence, has undergone
dramatic change since the late 19th century. The transition to adulthood has not 
been a smooth evolution, as this paper suggests. Rather, the transition has been 
affected by societal conditions. Future historical research of American youth
should look more closely at the differences between the sexes, as well as the
influence of socioeconomic status, ethnic background, environment, and so forth. 
For example, a possible study might look at social and psychological problems of 
male youth coming of age during World War II--or Korea or Vietnam--and how the
transition to adulthood was affected during these times. Other questions that
lend themselves to adolescent research include the following: How have youth been
affected by the economic climate (i.e., prolonged during affluent times,
shortened during hard times)? What has been the historical trend in the
transition to adulthood, and what have been the corresponding social and
psychological adjustments? How has the youth culture influenced the adolescent
experience in American society? Finally, an area that invites further
research--especially with the growing interest in women's studies and the new
concern with the male role in society--is the different role expectations of male
and female youth, and how these expectations relate to the transition process.
